# Create META-PRP with Orchestrator Multi-Agent Coordination

Create comprehensive meta-PRPs that coordinate complex multi-step plans using the task orchestrator's full orchestration
capabilities with sub-agent coordination, git worktree isolation, and executive dysfunction design principles.

## Meta-PRP Concept: $ARGUMENTS

## Template Reference

**CRITICAL**: Refer to `PRPs/templates/meta_prp_structure.md` for the complete hierarchical structure template with
executive dysfunction design patterns and git worktree strategy.

## Pre-Execution Orchestrator Health Check

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**

```bash
# Verify orchestrator connection and full functionality
claude mcp list | grep task-orchestrator || (echo "ORCHESTRATOR NOT CONNECTED - Fixing..." && claude mcp restart task-orchestrator)

# Test orchestrator health before meta-coordination
# This is critical for multi-agent workflows
```

If orchestrator fails, STOP and spawn fix agent per CLAUDE.md protocol.

## Enhanced Context References

**CRITICAL**: Load and reference these enhanced AI documentation files:

```yaml
required_context:
  - file: PRPs/v2.0-release-meta-prp/meta-coordination-orchestrator.md
    why: "Meta-PRP coordination patterns and orchestrator integration examples"
    sections: ["Orchestrator Tools Integration", "Phase Structure", "Testing Matrix"]

## Meta-PRP Design Principles

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Main Orchestrator Agent**: Creates and manages task breakdown using orchestrator_plan_task
- **Sub-Agent Coordination**: Each sub-agent gets specific orchestrator tasks with specialist contexts
- **Automatic Artifact Storage**: Task completion via orchestrator_complete_task stores detailed work
- **Result Synthesis**: orchestrator_synthesize_results aggregates sub-agent outputs
- **No Manual Summaries**: Orchestrator artifacts replace traditional result aggregation

## Enhanced Discovery Process with Multi-Agent Coordination

**Use Orchestrator for Meta-Coordination:**

```yaml
orchestrator_meta_session:
  session_name: "meta-prp-{concept}-creation"
  working_directory: "/current/project/path"
  expected_duration: "varies by complexity"
  
orchestrator_meta_task:
  title: "Meta-PRP Creation: {concept}"
  description: "Create comprehensive multi-agent coordination PRP for {concept}"
  complexity: "very_complex"
  task_type: "breakdown"
  specialist_type: "architect"
  
sub_task_coordination:
  - orchestrator_plan_task: "Research and analysis coordination"
  - orchestrator_plan_task: "Architecture design coordination"
  - orchestrator_plan_task: "Implementation planning coordination"
  - orchestrator_plan_task: "Testing strategy coordination"
  - orchestrator_get_status: "Track all coordination progress"
```

1. **Enhanced Concept Analysis with Sub-Agents**
   - **Main Agent**: Use orchestrator_plan_task to create research coordination
   - **Research Sub-Agent**: Gets orchestrator task with "researcher" specialist type
   - **Architecture Sub-Agent**: Gets orchestrator task with "architect" specialist type
   - **Security Sub-Agent**: Gets orchestrator task with specialist focus on security analysis
   - **Context Engineering**: Each sub-agent references relevant PRPs/ai_docs/ patterns

2. **Multi-Phase Planning with Orchestrator Breakdown**
   - **Phase Structure**: Mirror meta-coordination-orchestrator.md patterns
   - **Task Hierarchy**: Use nested orchestrator tasks for complex breakdowns
   - **Specialist Assignment**: Assign appropriate specialist types to sub-tasks
   - **Dependency Management**: Use orchestrator task dependencies for workflow coordination

3. **User Research & Validation with Coordinator Pattern**
   - **Main Coordinator**: Synthesizes research from all sub-agents
   - **Validation Sub-Agent**: Specifically assigned to validate assumptions
   - **Requirements Sub-Agent**: Focuses on gathering comprehensive requirements
   - **Risk Assessment Sub-Agent**: Dedicated to risk analysis and mitigation

## Git Worktree Strategy for Multi-Agent Coordination

### Executive Dysfunction-Aware Worktree Management

**Problem**: Agent work conflicts create overwhelm and lost progress  
**Solution**: Isolated worktrees with automated coordination patterns

```bash
# Create Meta-PRP with worktree structure
PRPs/{project-name}-transition/
├── README.md                    # Navigation and overview
├── 00-main-coordination/        # Central hub (main branch)
├── 01-priority-1/              # Worktree: feature/priority-1
├── 02-priority-2/              # Worktree: feature/priority-2
└── tracking/                   # Shared progress tracking

# Agent isolation strategy
main-repo/                      # Main repository
worktrees/
├── agent-priority-1/          # git worktree for priority 1
├── agent-priority-2/          # git worktree for priority 2
└── agent-coordination/        # git worktree for main coordination
```

### Worktree Creation Pattern

```bash
# Create worktrees for each priority area
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-{priority-name} -b feature/{priority-name}

# Agent auto-preservation (executive dysfunction support)
cd ../worktrees/agent-{priority-name}
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: Auto-save $(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# When agent completes work
git add -A && git commit -m "feat({scope}): {agent task completion}"

# Merge back to main when ready
cd ../../main-repo
git merge feature/{priority-name}
git worktree remove ../worktrees/agent-{priority-name}
```

### Agent Spawning with Worktree Context

```yaml
agent_spawning_with_worktrees:
  research_agent:
    worktree: "../worktrees/agent-research"
    branch: "feature/research-phase"
    specialist_context_retrieval:
      action: orchestrator_execute_task
      working_directory: "../worktrees/agent-research"
      
    sub_agent_instructions: |
      You are working in an ISOLATED WORKTREE for executive dysfunction support
      
      WORKTREE INTEGRATION:
      - Working directory: ../worktrees/agent-research
      - Branch: feature/research-phase  
      - Auto-preservation: WIP commits every 30 minutes
      - No conflicts with other agents
      
      ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION:
      - Use orchestrator_execute_task to get your context
      - Store ALL work in orchestrator artifacts
      - Reference meta-PRP structure template
      
      EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION SUPPORT:
      - Pre-created directory structure reduces decisions
      - Isolated environment prevents overwhelm
      - Progress automatically preserved via git
      - Clear single focus area
```

## Meta-PRP Generation with Orchestrator Integration
