## Codebase Analysis Results for Enhanced Code Review Command

### Existing Code Review Commands Analysis

1. **Current Commands**:
   - `review-general.md`: Basic 94-line review with Python/Pydantic focus
   - `review-staged-unstaged.md`: Similar structure, focuses on git staging area
   - `refactor-simple.md`: Quick refactoring check (34 lines)

2. **Current Limitations**:
   - Basic structure lacking comprehensive methodology
   - Limited security checklist (only 4 basic items)  
   - No severity categorization framework
   - No cross-language support
   - Simple output format without actionable guidance
   - No systematic validation approach

### Testing and Validation Patterns Found

1. **Testing Structure**:
   - **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/` with markers (@pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration)
   - **Security tests**: `tests/security/` with comprehensive security validation
   - **Performance tests**: `tests/performance/` for benchmarking
   - **Validation framework**: `tests/validation_gates/` with systematic validation

2. **Security Testing Patterns**:
   - XSS prevention testing with payload validation
   - Input validation with comprehensive sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention patterns
   - Path traversal protection
   - Information disclosure prevention

3. **Linting and Quality Tools**:
   - **Black** for code formatting (line-length: 88)
   - **isort** for import sorting (profile: "black")
   - **pytest** with asyncio support and coverage
   - **mypy** for type checking (when configured)
   - Resource cleanup validation to prevent warnings

### Quality and Architecture Patterns

1. **Clean Architecture Implementation**:
   - Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Presentation layers
   - Repository pattern with abstract interfaces
   - Dependency injection container
   - Error handling with severity levels
   - Resource management with context managers

2. **File Organization**:
   - Status tagging system for lifecycle management
   - PRPs framework for systematic development
   - Validation framework at `PRPs/validation/`
   - AI documentation system at `PRPs/ai_docs/`

3. **Git and Development Patterns**:
   - Mandatory git commit after every task
   - Descriptive commit messages with scope
   - Pre-commit hooks for validation
   - Status tag compliance checking

### Command Structure Patterns

1. **Argument Handling**: `$ARGUMENTS` variable for flexible scope
2. **Structured Output**: Markdown reports with severity categorization
3. **File References**: `file:line` format for precise issue location
4. **Report Storage**: `PRPs/code_reviews/` directory with numbered reports

### Recommendations for Enhanced Command

1. **Adopt Comprehensive Methodology**: Integrate systematic approaches from external research
2. **Implement Severity Framework**: Critical/Important/Minor with actionable guidance
3. **Add Security-First Design**: Comprehensive security checklist integration
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Language-agnostic patterns while maintaining Python specifics
5. **Validation Integration**: Connect with existing validation framework
6. **Enhanced Reporting**: Detailed reports with context and remediation steps
