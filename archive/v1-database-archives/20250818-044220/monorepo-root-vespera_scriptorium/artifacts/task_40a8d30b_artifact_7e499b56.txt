Created comprehensive meta-PRP document "PRPs/atomic-ci-fixes-meta-prp.md" that decomposes code review findings into highly granular, context-contained atomic tasks specifically designed for execution by resource-constrained local LLMs.

Key deliverables:

1. **Task Classification System**: 
   - ✅ High readiness tasks (<1000 tokens, 95%+ success rate)
   - 🟡 Medium readiness tasks (1000-2000 tokens, 80%+ success rate)  
   - ❌ Low readiness tasks (>2000 tokens, require larger models)

2. **Atomic Task Breakdown**:
   - P1.1: Branch Protection Configuration (2 atomic tasks, ✅ ready)
   - P1.2: Maintenance Workflow Debug (2 atomic tasks, ✅ ready)
   - P2.1: Workspace Configuration (2 atomic tasks, ✅ ready)
   - P2.2: CI Path Corrections (1 atomic task, ✅ ready)
   - P3.1: Build Script Improvements (1 atomic task, 🟡 ready)

3. **Structured Prompt Templates**: Each atomic task includes:
   - Exact input specifications
   - Context size requirements
   - Structured prompts with examples
   - Validation commands
   - Expected output formats

4. **Local LLM Optimization Strategy**:
   - Maximum 2000 tokens per task
   - Single file focus per task
   - Clear input/output boundaries
   - Automated validation framework

5. **Progressive Automation Framework**:
   - Phase 1: Manual execution with structured prompts
   - Phase 2: Semi-automated with validation
   - Phase 3: Full automation pipeline

6. **Orchestrator Integration**: Task coordination using orchestrator tools for multi-agent workflows

The meta-PRP successfully transforms complex CI/CD issues into 8 atomic tasks that can be executed independently by local LLMs, with 7 out of 8 tasks classified as high readiness (✅) for 8GB VRAM environments.
