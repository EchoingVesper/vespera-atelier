Successfully established new v2 project structure and foundation:

**NEW PROJECT STRUCTURE CREATED:**

1. **Updated README.md**
   - Complete rewrite focusing on v2 vision
   - Clear development phases and timeline
   - Architecture overview with visual structure
   - User-focused creative suite positioning

2. **New ARCHITECTURE.md**  
   - Comprehensive Clean Architecture specification
   - Triple database ecosystem design (SQLite + KuzuDB + Chroma)
   - Modular package structure with clear separation
   - Role system with capability-based permissions
   - Plugin architecture for Obsidian + VS Code

3. **Directory Structure**

**ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS DOCUMENTED:**
- Clean Architecture layers with DDD principles
- Executive dysfunction-aware design patterns
- Local-first approach with embedded databases
- Modular microservices for scalability
- Dual plugin strategy (Obsidian + VS Code)
- Role-based AI with capability restrictions

**PRESERVED ELEMENTS:**
- PRPs/ system (proven meta-PRP methodology)
- plugins/Obsidian/ (active development)
- VESPERA_VISION_PLANNING_WORKSHEET.md (architectural decisions)
- Core documentation structure

**READY FOR NEXT PHASE:**
- Foundation package structure established
- Architecture fully specified and documented
- Clean slate for implementing modular backend
- Development workflow prepared for specialist agents
