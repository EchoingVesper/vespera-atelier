Successfully completed systematic cleanup of obsolete repository content:

**ARCHIVED TO archive/v1-reference/:**
- docs/ (old maintenance docs)
- plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium/ (obsolete v1 plugin)
- PRPs/completed/vespera-scriptorium-* (v1 orchestrator-specific PRPs)
- PRPs/completed/infrastructure/ (v1 CI/CD and test suite fixes)
- PRPs/draft/obsidian-backend-integration/ (no longer applicable for v2)

**PRESERVED ON MAIN BRANCH:**
- PRPs/templates/ (proven meta-PRP system)
- PRPs/ai_docs/ (valuable patterns and guides)
- PRPs/in-progress/vespera-v2-ground-up-rewrite/ (current v2 project)
- PRPs/completed/ (universal PRPs like code-review-command)
- packages/vespera-scriptorium/ (active orchestrator with backup)
- .claude/ directory (needs minor cleanup but functional)

**CREATED CLEAN STRUCTURE:**
- plugins/Obsidian/ (empty, ready for v2 plugin development)
- archive/v1-reference/ with organized subdirectories:
  - archive/v1-reference/docs/ (old maintenance docs)
  - archive/v1-reference/plugins/ (v1 Obsidian plugin)
  - archive/v1-reference/PRPs/completed-v1-specific/ (v1-era PRPs)

**IMPORTANT NOTE - VENV PATH:**
The Python venv is now located at:
`packages/vespera-scriptorium/vespera-scriptorium-backup/venv/`

Claude Code may need configuration update to use this path instead of the old 
`packages/vespera-scriptorium/venv/` location.

**REMAINING CLEANUP CANDIDATES:**
- .claude/ directory has some old configs that could be streamlined
- Some archived PRPs in completed/ might need further review

**GIT STATUS:**
- 695 files changed in systematic cleanup
- All obsolete content preserved in organized archive structure
- Main branch now significantly cleaner while retaining all reference material
- Repository ready for v2 development with clear separation

The repository is now much cleaner while preserving all valuable content for reference. The v1 orchestrator remains functional with proper backup structure.
