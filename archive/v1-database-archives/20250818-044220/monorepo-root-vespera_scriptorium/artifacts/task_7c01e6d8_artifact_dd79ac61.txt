## Priority 2: Workspace Configuration Fixes - Complete Implementation

### 🔧 Package.json Workspace Configuration
**File Updated:** `package.json`

**Workspace Configuration Enhanced:**
- Added `packages/*` to workspaces array to include all packages in packages/ directory
- Maintained existing `vespera-utilities` and `plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium` references
- Fixed workspace path structure to match actual monorepo organization

**Before:**
```json
"workspaces": [
  "vespera-utilities",
  "plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium"
]
```

**After:**
```json
"workspaces": [
  "packages/*",
  "vespera-utilities", 
  "plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium"
]
```

### 📦 PNPM Workspace Configuration
**File Updated:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

**Improvements Made:**
- Added `packages/*` pattern to include all packages in packages/ directory
- Updated documentation to clarify Python package handling
- Maintained compatibility with existing Node.js packages

**Enhanced Configuration:**
```yaml
packages:
  # All packages in packages/ directory (includes both Node.js and Python packages)
  - 'packages/*'
  
  # Additional Node.js packages that can be managed by pnpm workspaces
  - 'vespera-utilities'
  - 'plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium'
  
  # Note: packages/vespera-scriptorium is a Python package and managed separately via pip
  # It's included in the monorepo structure for consistency but pip handles its dependencies
```

### 🎯 Addresses GitHub Issue
- **Issue #13**: Monorepo Workspace Configuration Issues - ✅ RESOLVED
  - Package.json workspace configuration corrected to include packages/*
  - PNPM workspace paths verified and updated
  - Workspace path structure now matches actual directory organization
  - Both Node.js and Python packages properly included in workspace

### 🔍 Validation Results
- Workspace configuration now includes all packages in packages/ directory
- PNPM workspace configuration properly structured for monorepo management
- Path references are consistent with actual directory structure
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing configuration

### 📂 Directory Structure Validated
- Confirmed `packages/vespera-scriptorium/` exists (Python package)
- Confirmed `vespera-utilities/` exists at root level (Node.js package)
- Confirmed `plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium/` exists (Node.js package)
- All workspace paths verified against actual repository structure

### 🚀 Next Steps for CI Working Directories
This fix resolves the workspace configuration issues. CI working directory issues will be addressed through:
1. Enhanced maintenance workflow (already implemented in Priority 1)
2. Proper build script environment setup (being addressed in Priority 3)
3. Updated GitHub Actions workflow paths to use correct working directories

### 🛠️ Build System Compatibility
The workspace configuration changes ensure:
- All packages are discoverable by pnpm workspace commands
- Python packages are properly handled separately via pip
- Node.js packages can use workspace dependencies correctly
- Monorepo commands work across all package types
