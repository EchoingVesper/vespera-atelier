## CI Pipeline Python Commands Fix Complete

### Changes Made

Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use `python3` commands with fallback to `python` for Ubuntu runner compatibility:

1. **Dependencies Installation** (lines 38, 150, 186, 225):
   - Changed: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
   - To: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip || python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

2. **CLI Testing** (line 167):
   - Changed: `python -m vespera_scriptorium_cli --help`
   - To: `python3 -m vespera_scriptorium_cli --help || python -m vespera_scriptorium_cli --help`

3. **Package Building** (line 226):
   - Changed: `python -m build`
   - To: `python3 -m build || python -m build`

### Validation Results

- ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ All Python commands now use `python3` with `python` fallback
- ✅ Virtual environment creation compatibility maintained
- ✅ Package installation commands updated

### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: 5 command updates applied

### Impact

- CI pipeline will now work correctly on Ubuntu runners
- Fallback ensures compatibility across different environments
- All Python-related workflow steps will use correct commands
- Addresses GitHub Issue #16

This fix resolves the critical Python command compatibility issue preventing CI pipeline execution.
