### Workspace Organization Principles

#### 1. **Package Hierarchy**
- **packages/**: Reusable, publishable npm packages
- **apps/**: Applications that consume packages
- **tools/**: Development and build utilities

#### 2. **Dependency Flow**
```
apps/* → packages/* ← tools/*
```
- Apps depend on packages
- Tools support both apps and packages
- Packages should be independent of apps

#### 3. **Publishing Strategy**
- Packages publish to npm with `@vespera/` scope
- Apps are deployment artifacts, not published
- Tools may be published for external use

### CLAUDE.md Placement Strategy

#### Strategic Locations:
1. **Root CLAUDE.md** - Overall project guidance and monorepo patterns
2. **packages/*/CLAUDE.md** - Package-specific development guidance
3. **apps/*/CLAUDE.md** - Application-specific patterns and integration
4. **tools/CLAUDE.md** - Build and development tool guidance

#### Content Strategy:
- **Root**: Monorepo management, workspace commands, architecture overview
- **Package**: Package development patterns, API design, testing strategies
- **App**: Integration patterns, deployment considerations, user-facing features
- **Tools**: Build system, CI/CD, development workflow

### Technology Stack Decisions

#### Build System:
- **Turborepo**: For build orchestration and caching
- **PNPM**: For efficient package management and workspaces
- **TypeScript**: Consistent across all packages

#### Development Tools:
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code style across workspace
- **Husky + lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks
- **Changesets**: Automated versioning and changelog
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines

#### Package Management:
- **Scoped packages**: `@vespera/utilities`, `@vespera/core`
- **Semantic versioning**: Automated with changesets
- **Cross-package dependencies**: Managed through workspace protocol

### Scalability Considerations

#### Future Growth:
- **Plugin packages**: Easy addition of new plugin collections
- **Service packages**: Backend services as workspace packages
- **Integration packages**: Third-party service integrations
- **Testing packages**: Shared testing utilities

#### Performance:
- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild changed packages
- **Selective testing**: Run tests only for affected packages
- **Caching**: Build artifacts cached across CI runs

### Security Architecture

#### Package Boundaries:
- Clear separation between public and internal packages
- Explicit dependency declarations
- No circular dependencies between packages

#### CI/CD Security:
- Automated security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Secure release process with provenance

### Deployment Strategy

#### Package Publishing:
- Automated publishing on release
- Beta/alpha channels for pre-releases
- Rollback capabilities

#### Application Deployment:
- Container-based deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Blue-green deployment support

### Migration Considerations

#### From Current Structure:
1. **vespera-utilities** moves to `packages/vespera-utilities/`
2. **Task orchestrator artifacts** preserved during migration
3. **Git history** maintained
4. **Build scripts** adapted for workspace

#### Breaking Changes:
- Import paths may change for internal dependencies
- Build commands become workspace-aware
- Configuration files move to workspace root

### Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Phase 1**: Create structure and migrate vespera-utilities
2. **Phase 2**: Set up workspace tooling and CI/CD
3. **Phase 3**: Extract shared code to vespera-core
4. **Phase 4**: Create example application integration

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Vespera ecosystem while maintaining flexibility for future growth.
