**Summary:** Researched MCP server architecture and plugin design patterns for TypeScript

## Detailed Work

## MCP Server Architecture Research Summary

### Key Findings

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Overview**
   - Open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs
   - TypeScript SDK available at `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
   - Supports tools, resources, prompts, and notifications
   - Multiple transport options: Stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE (deprecated)

2. **Core Server Components**
   - `McpServer` class: Main server interface
   - Tools: Functions that LLMs can call
   - Resources: Static or dynamic data sources
   - Prompts: Reusable templates for LLM interactions
   - Transport layers handle communication

3. **Plugin Architecture Patterns**
   - Mediator pattern recommended for plugin communication
   - Observer pattern for event-driven plugin systems
   - Dynamic tool/resource registration supported natively
   - Tools can be enabled/disabled/updated/removed at runtime

4. **Best Practices Identified**
   - Keep files under 500 lines (as requested)
   - Use Zod for schema validation
   - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Support dynamic loading/unloading of functionality
   - Use dependency injection for extensibility

5. **Transport Considerations**
   - Streamable HTTP is the modern approach
   - Support for stateless and stateful modes
   - Session management built-in
   - Backwards compatibility with SSE if needed

### Recommended Architecture Approach

For the Vespera Utilities project, I recommend:
1. Core plugin system using mediator pattern
2. Each plugin as a separate module with defined interface
3. Dynamic registration of MCP tools/resources per plugin
4. Configuration-driven plugin loading
5. TypeScript interfaces for type safety
