## Detailed Work

Successfully implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline for the Vespera Atelier monorepo with the following components:

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Enhanced multi-stage pipeline** with health check, lint, typecheck, build, test, and security stages
- **Multi-version testing** across Node.js 18, 20, and 22
- **Package size monitoring** with automatic reporting in GitHub step summaries
- **Coverage reporting** integration with Codecov
- **Quality gate** that ensures all checks pass before allowing merges
- **Concurrency control** to prevent resource conflicts
- **Build caching** with pnpm for faster execution
- **Artifact management** for build outputs with 7-day retention

### 2. Automated Release (.github/workflows/release.yml)
- **Changesets integration** for semantic versioning and release management
- **Dual publishing** to both npm registry and GitHub Packages
- **Automated release notes** generation from changesets
- **Release PR automation** for version bumps
- **Proper permissions** for package publishing and repository writes

### 3. Dependency Updates (.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml)
- **Scheduled weekly updates** every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- **Automated PR creation** with dependency change summaries
- **Manual trigger** capability for on-demand updates
- **Proper labeling** and categorization of dependency PRs

### 4. Security Scanning (.github/workflows/security-scan.yml)
- **Daily security audits** at 2 AM UTC
- **CodeQL analysis** for static code security scanning
- **Secret scanning** with TruffleHog for exposed credentials
- **npm audit integration** with vulnerability reporting
- **Snyk integration** for additional security analysis
- **Security alerts** in GitHub step summaries

## Configuration Files

### 5. Changeset Configuration (.changeset/config.json)
- **Fixed versioning groups** to ensure coordinated releases
- **Proper access settings** for public package publishing
- **Internal dependency management** with patch-level updates
- **Experimental options** for better peer dependency handling

### 6. CodeQL Configuration (.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml)
- **Security-focused queries** with extended security ruleset
- **Proper path inclusion/exclusion** for relevant code scanning
- **Test file exclusion** to focus on production code

### 7. Enhanced Package Scripts
- **Changeset status command** for checking unreleased changes
- **CI-optimized test commands** with coverage and watch modes
- **Build artifact management** and cleanup scripts

## Security Features
- **Vulnerability scanning** with multiple tools (npm audit, Snyk, CodeQL)
- **Secret detection** with TruffleHog
- **Automated security reporting** with summaries and artifacts
- **Proper token management** using GitHub secrets

## Performance Optimizations
- **Build caching** with pnpm store caching
- **Artifact sharing** between workflow jobs
- **Concurrency controls** to prevent resource conflicts
- **Optimized package size monitoring** with compression analysis

## Quality Assurance
- **Multi-stage validation** before allowing merges
- **Comprehensive test coverage** across all Node.js versions
- **Automated formatting** and linting checks
- **Type safety** validation with TypeScript

This implementation provides a production-ready CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliable automated releases while maintaining excellent developer experience.
