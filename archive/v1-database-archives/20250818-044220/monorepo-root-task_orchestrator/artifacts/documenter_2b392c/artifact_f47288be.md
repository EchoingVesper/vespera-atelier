## Strategic CLAUDE.md Documentation System

Created a comprehensive documentation system specifically designed for AI assistance across the Vespera Atelier monorepo. The documentation follows a hierarchical approach with specialized guidance for each area of the project.

### Documentation Architecture

#### 1. **Root Level CLAUDE.md** (`/CLAUDE.md`)
**Comprehensive monorepo guidance covering**:

- **Repository Architecture**: Complete structure overview and workspace organization
- **Development Workflow**: Setup, build, test, and deployment procedures
- **Package Development Guidelines**: Specific guidance for each package type
- **Code Quality Standards**: TypeScript, linting, formatting, and testing requirements
- **MCP Integration**: Server implementation and tool development patterns
- **AI Assistant Guidelines**: Workflow-specific guidance for common tasks
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and debug procedures

**Key Features**:
- Emphasizes 500-line file limit constraint (critical for Claude Code)
- Comprehensive workspace command reference
- Plugin development patterns and best practices
- Error handling and debugging strategies
- Performance considerations and optimization

#### 2. **Package Level CLAUDE.md** (`/packages/vespera-utilities/CLAUDE.md`)
**Specialized guidance for the utilities package**:
- **Package-Specific Overview**: Focus on MCP server and plugin architecture

**Application Categories Covered**:
- **Main Application**: Primary user interface with MCP integration
- **Documentation Site**: API docs, tutorials, and guides
- **Playground**: Development and testing environment

#### 4. **Tools Level CLAUDE.md** (`/tools/CLAUDE.md`)
**Development tools and build system guidance**:
- **Tools Overview**: Build scripts, dev tools, and shared configurations
- **Development Principles**: Developer experience and cross-platform compatibility
- **Build Scripts**: Orchestration, release management, quality assurance
- **Development Tools**: Code generation, dev servers, debugging utilities
- **Configuration Management**: Shared configs and environment handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, parallel processing, and monitoring

**Tool Categories**:
- **build-scripts/**: Package building and release automation
- **dev-tools/**: Development workflow enhancement utilities
- **config/**: Shared configuration templates and validation
