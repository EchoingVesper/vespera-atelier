## üóÉÔ∏è **SECTION 1: DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current State**: Single SQLite database

### **Vision**: Triple database ecosystem

**Q1.1**: Vector Database Choice

- [x] Chroma (embedded, Python-native)
- [ ] Weaviate (more features, external service)
- [ ] FAISS (Facebook, fast but basic)
- [ ] Qdrant (Rust-based, high performance)
- [ ] Other: ________________________________
- **Your choice**: **Chroma - embedded, developer-friendly, persistent storage, good performance for most use cases**

**Q1.2**: Graph Database Choice  

- [ ] Neo4j (industry standard, requires service)
- [ ] NetworkX (Python-native, in-memory)
- [ ] SQLite with graph tables (simple, embedded)
- [ ] Redis Graph (if using Redis)
- [x] KuzuDB (embedded, Cypher support, extremely fast)
- [ ] Other: ________________________________
- **Your choice**: **KuzuDB - embedded like SQLite, supports Cypher queries, 18-188x faster than Neo4j, NetworkX integration, perfect for embedded use**

**Q1.3**: Deployment Preference

- [x] All embedded (easier setup, single process)
- [ ] External services (more powerful, complex setup)
- [ ] Hybrid (SQLite + Vector embedded, Graph external)
- **Your choice**: **All embedded - KuzuDB and Chroma are both pip-installable with no external services**

**Q1.4**: Project Root Restriction

- [ ] STRICT: Only one .vespera_scriptorium per project root
- [x] FLEXIBLE: Allow subdirectory instances for large projects
- **Your choice**: **FLEXIBLE with hierarchical context nesting - master instance manages child instances via event-driven registration system**

---

## ü§ñ **SECTION 2: ROLE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current State**: Basic role definitions

### **Vision**: User-editable role templates with LLM associations

```yaml
# Proposed structure - modified based on Roo Code inspiration:
role_name:
  display_name: "Human-readable name"
  description: "What this role does"
  system_prompt: "Base prompt for this role"
  preferred_llm: "local:ollama:llama3" # Local-first approach

   git push origin archive/v1-legacy
   git tag v1-archive-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   git push origin --tags
   ```

2. **Preserve PRPs System & Archive Content**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   # Keep the PRP system but archive existing PRPs
   mkdir -p archive/v1-prps
   mv PRPs/completed/* archive/v1-prps/ 2>/dev/null || true
   mv PRPs/draft/* archive/v1-prps/ 2>/dev/null || true
   
   # Archive old implementation files but keep .claude/commands/PRPs structure
   git rm -rf scriptorium/ src/ tests/ 2>/dev/null || true
   # Keep: .claude/commands/PRPs/, PRPs/templates/, PRPs/README.md
   # Archive: completed PRPs, draft PRPs, old code
   ```

3. **New Project Structure**:

**Notes Section**:

This represents a complete architectural reboot based on lessons learned from v1 and research into modern practices. The focus is on building a modular, scalable foundation that can grow into the full creative suite vision while being immediately useful for project management and creative work.

**Preserving What Works**: The PRP system (.claude/commands/PRPs/ and templates) has proven invaluable for orchestrating complex development tasks and will be retained and adapted for the new architecture. Existing PRPs will be archived to preserve lessons learned while starting fresh for v2 development.

Key inspirations: Roo Code's role system, Archon's microservices approach, modular Unix philosophy, and Japanese design principles for simplicity and reliability.

The dual-plugin strategy allows leveraging existing mature editors while building toward eventual standalone creative tools.
