# Task: Documentation & Task Tracking

**Goal:**
Document these changes and ensure ongoing issues are tracked.

## Proposed Code Edits

- **README.md, docs/modules/summarization.md**: Update docs to reflect new timeout, naming, and error handling behaviors.
- **docs/TASK.md, docs/tracking/**: Record these as issues/tasks, and log any discovered issues during work under “Discovered During Work.”

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation is up-to-date and accurate.
- All tasks and issues are tracked per project conventions.
