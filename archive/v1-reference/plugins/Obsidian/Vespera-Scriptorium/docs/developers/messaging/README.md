# A2A Messaging System Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-25

## Overview

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) messaging system provides the foundation for communication between agents in the Vespera Scriptorium's Protocol-Based Architecture. This documentation covers the implementation details, usage patterns, and best practices for each component of the messaging system.

## Components

The A2A messaging system consists of the following core components:

1. [**NATS Client**](./nats-client/README.md) - Core messaging client for publish/subscribe and request/reply patterns
2. [**Service Manager**](./service-manager/README.md) - Handles service discovery, registration, and health monitoring
3. [**Task Manager**](./task-manager/README.md) - Manages task lifecycle, delegation, and retry mechanisms
4. [**Storage Manager**](./storage-manager/README.md) - Provides distributed key-value storage operations
5. [**Data Exchange**](./data-exchange/README.md) - Facilitates data sharing between agents with streaming support

## Message Types

The [Message Types](./MESSAGE_TYPES.md) documentation provides a comprehensive reference for all message types used in the A2A communication layer, including:

- System messages (heartbeat, register, unregister)
- Task management messages
- Storage operation messages
- Data exchange messages
- Error handling messages

## Getting Started

To use the A2A messaging system in your agent implementation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the NATS client and connect to the message broker
2. Set up the Service Manager to register your agent and discover other agents
3. Use the Task Manager to create, delegate, and process tasks
4. Leverage the Storage Manager for distributed data storage
5. Utilize the Data Exchange for sharing data between agents

For detailed implementation examples, refer to the documentation for each component.

## Implementation Status

The current implementation status of the A2A messaging system is:

- âœ… NATS Client - Fully implemented
- âœ… Service Manager - Fully implemented
- âœ… Message Types - Fully implemented
- âœ… Task Manager - Fully implemented
- âœ… Storage Manager - Fully implemented
- âœ… Data Exchange - Fully implemented
- ðŸ”„ Integration Testing - In progress
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced Features - Pending

## Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces and type guards for message handling
2. **Idempotency**: Design message handlers to be idempotent
3. **Timeouts**: Always set appropriate timeouts for operations
4. **Retries**: Use the built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. **Correlation IDs**: Include correlation IDs in all messages for tracing
6. **Error Handling**: Use the enhanced error payloads for detailed error information
7. **Event-Based Architecture**: Use the event emitters for loosely coupled components
8. **Service Discovery**: Leverage the service discovery for dynamic agent capabilities
9. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for message handlers
