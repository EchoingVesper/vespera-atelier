# Phase 2: Short-term Improvements Checklist

This checklist tracks progress on implementing short-term improvements for chunking errors in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These improvements should be completed within 1-2 weeks.

## 1. Chunking Process

### Refactoring the Chunker
- [ ] Separate chunking logic into modular components
- [ ] Implement clean interfaces between components
- [ ] Refactor chunk creation to ensure data integrity

### Robust ID Generation
- [ ] Design deterministic ID generation system
- [ ] Implement ID validation and verification
- [ ] Create unique ID conflict resolution

### Chunk Metadata Improvements
- [ ] Add position tracking metadata
- [ ] Implement parent-child relationship tracking
- [ ] Create metadata indexing for efficient lookup

### Testing Chunking Process
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for chunker
- [ ] Test chunk relationships and hierarchy preservation
- [ ] Verify metadata consistency across operations

## 2. Incremental Processing

### Disk-Based Storage Implementation
- [ ] Design disk storage format for chunks
- [ ] Implement chunk serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Create disk I/O manager for chunk operations

### Streaming Document Assembly
- [ ] Implement streaming document assembly
- [ ] Add progress tracking for assembly operations
- [ ] Create pause/resume capabilities

### Cache Management
- [ ] Design intelligent caching policy
- [ ] Implement cache size limitations
- [ ] Create cache invalidation strategy

### Testing Incremental Processing
- [ ] Test with extremely large documents
- [ ] Verify processing resumption after interruption
- [ ] Measure performance improvements

## 3. Diagnostics

### Memory Usage Logging
- [ ] Add detailed memory usage reporting
- [ ] Implement per-component memory tracking
- [ ] Create memory usage history visualization

### Performance Metrics Collection
- [ ] Add timing measurements for key operations
- [ ] Implement throughput metrics collection
- [ ] Create performance bottleneck detection

### Diagnostic Dashboard
- [ ] Design user-friendly diagnostic dashboard
- [ ] Implement real-time metrics display
- [ ] Add export capability for diagnostic data

### Testing Diagnostics
- [ ] Verify accuracy of memory usage reporting
- [ ] Test performance metrics under various conditions
- [ ] Validate dashboard functionality

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Chunking Process - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Incremental Processing - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Diagnostics - NOT STARTED

## Next Steps
After completing these short-term improvements, proceed to [Phase 3: Long-term Enhancements](../03-long-term-enhancements/long-term-enhancements-checklist.md).
