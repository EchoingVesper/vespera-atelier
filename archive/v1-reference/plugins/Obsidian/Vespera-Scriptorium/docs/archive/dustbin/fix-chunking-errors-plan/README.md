# Vespera Scriptorium Chunking Errors Fix Plan

This documentation provides a comprehensive plan to address the memory issues and chunking errors identified in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. The plan is organized into three main phases, with detailed steps for implementation.

## Problem Summary

Based on the logs, the Vespera Scriptorium plugin is experiencing memory issues during document processing. Key issues include:

1. Missing chunk IDs during sorting
2. Inefficient memory management during document assembly
3. No error handling for memory-intensive operations
4. Accumulation of chunked data without proper cleanup

## Implementation Plan

The fix plan is divided into three phases:

### [1. Immediate Fixes](./01-immediate-fixes/README.md)
Quick solutions to prevent crashes and stabilize the plugin:

- [Chunk ID Fixes](./01-immediate-fixes/chunk-id-fixes/README.md) - Address missing chunk IDs issue
- [Memory Limits](./01-immediate-fixes/memory-limits/README.md) - Implement basic memory constraints
- [Error Handling](./01-immediate-fixes/error-handling/README.md) - Add error recovery for processing operations

### [2. Short-term Improvements](./02-short-term-improvements/README.md)
Medium-term solutions to enhance stability and efficiency:

- [Chunking Process](./02-short-term-improvements/chunking-process/README.md) - Refactor the chunking mechanism
- [Incremental Processing](./02-short-term-improvements/incremental-processing/README.md) - Implement disk-based storage
- [Diagnostics](./02-short-term-improvements/diagnostics/README.md) - Add memory usage logging

### [3. Long-term Enhancements](./03-long-term-enhancements/README.md)
Comprehensive solutions for robust performance:

- [Document Assembly](./03-long-term-enhancements/document-assembly/README.md) - Overhaul the document assembly system
- [Storage Solutions](./03-long-term-enhancements/storage-solutions/README.md) - Implement database-backed storage
- [Recovery System](./03-long-term-enhancements/recovery-system/README.md) - Create advanced error recovery

## Implementation Timeline

1. Immediate Fixes: 1-2 days
2. Short-term Improvements: 1-2 weeks
3. Long-term Enhancements: 1-2 months

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing each fix:

1. Process a large document (>10 pages)
2. Monitor memory usage during processing
3. Verify proper chunk ID assignment
4. Test recovery from simulated errors
