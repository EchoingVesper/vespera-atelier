# Incremental Processing Improvements

This section provides detailed instructions for implementing incremental processing in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These improvements will help reduce memory usage by processing chunks incrementally and storing intermediate results on disk.

2. [Streaming Document Assembly](./02-streaming.md)
3. [Cache Management](./03-cache-management.md)
4. [Testing Incremental Processing](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current implementation appears to load all chunks into memory before processing, which can lead to memory issues with large documents. Incremental processing will:

1. Process chunks in smaller batches
2. Store intermediate results on disk
3. Use streaming to assemble the final document
4. Implement efficient cache management

By implementing these improvements, we can significantly reduce memory usage and improve the plugin's ability to handle large documents without crashing.

## Implementation Timeline

These improvements should take approximately 2-3 days to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these improvements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the chunking process improvements
2. A good understanding of file I/O in Obsidian plugins
3. Familiarity with streaming and async patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript
