# Short-term Improvements for Chunking System

This section outlines the short-term improvements needed to enhance the stability and efficiency of the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These improvements build upon the immediate fixes and provide a more robust solution to the chunking issues.

## Implementation Approach

These improvements should be implemented in the following order:

1. First, refactor the chunking process to ensure proper ID assignment
2. Next, implement incremental processing with disk-based storage
3. Finally, add memory usage logging and diagnostics

Each improvement should be tested thoroughly before proceeding to the next. The entire set of short-term improvements should take approximately 1-2 weeks to implement and test.

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these short-term improvements:

- The plugin should handle documents of any size without memory issues
- Processing should be more efficient and use less memory
- The development team should have better visibility into memory usage and performance
- Users should experience fewer crashes and better performance

These improvements will significantly enhance the plugin's stability and efficiency while more comprehensive solutions are developed in the long-term phase.
