# Long-term Enhancements for Chunking System

This section outlines the long-term enhancements needed to create a robust, scalable solution for the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These enhancements build upon the immediate fixes and short-term improvements to provide a comprehensive solution that can handle large documents and complex processing requirements.

## Implementation Approach

These enhancements should be implemented in the following order:

1. First, redesign the document assembly system
2. Next, implement database-backed storage solutions
3. Finally, create an advanced recovery system

Each enhancement should be developed and tested thoroughly. The entire set of long-term enhancements should take approximately 1-2 months to implement and test.

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these long-term enhancements:

- The plugin should handle extremely large documents efficiently
- Data should be stored securely and with minimal memory footprint
- Users should have confidence in the plugin's ability to recover from errors
- The plugin should scale well with increasing document size and complexity

These enhancements will transform the plugin into a robust, enterprise-grade tool capable of handling complex document processing tasks without memory issues.
