# Phase 1: Immediate Fixes Checklist

This checklist tracks progress on implementing immediate fixes for chunking errors in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These fixes should be completed within 1-2 days.

## 1. Chunk ID Fixes

### Diagnosis and Issue Identification
- [x] Review error logs to identify patterns in missing chunk IDs
- [x] Analyze sortChunksByPosition function to find failure points
- [x] Document specific issues for targeted fixes

### Fix for sortChunksByPosition Function
- [x] Add null/undefined checks for chunk IDs
- [x] Implement fallback sorting mechanism
- [x] Test with sample data containing missing IDs

### Default ID Assignment Implementation
- [x] Create function to generate default IDs for chunks
- [x] Modify chunking process to ensure ID assignment
- [x] Implement validation of chunk IDs before sorting

### Testing Chunk ID Fixes
- [x] Test with documents containing various edge cases
- [x] Verify proper sorting with mixed invalid/valid IDs
- [x] Document results and any remaining edge cases

## 2. Memory Limits

### Basic Memory Monitoring
- [ ] Implement memory usage tracking
- [ ] Add logging for peak memory usage
- [ ] Create memory monitoring dashboard

### Setting Memory Thresholds
- [ ] Define safe memory thresholds
- [ ] Implement configurable limits
- [ ] Add documentation for threshold customization

### Implementing Memory Checks
- [ ] Add pre-operation memory availability checks
- [ ] Implement staged processing for large documents
- [ ] Create memory reclamation functions

### Testing Memory Limits
- [ ] Test with progressively larger documents
- [ ] Verify graceful handling near memory limits
- [ ] Document memory usage patterns

## 3. Error Handling

### Adding Try-Catch Blocks
- [ ] Identify critical sections requiring error handling
- [ ] Implement try-catch in the chunking process
- [ ] Add error logging with detailed context

### User Notification System
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement notification mechanism
- [ ] Add guidance for error resolution

### Graceful Degradation
- [ ] Implement partial processing capabilities
- [ ] Create fallback modes for high-memory situations
- [ ] Preserve partial results when errors occur

### Testing Error Handling
- [ ] Simulate various error conditions
- [ ] Verify recovery from each error type
- [ ] Test user experience during error scenarios

## Implementation Status
- [x] Chunk ID Fixes - COMPLETED
- [ ] Memory Limits - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Error Handling - NOT STARTED

## Next Steps
After completing these immediate fixes, proceed to [Phase 2: Short-term Improvements](../02-short-term-improvements/short-term-improvements-checklist.md).
