# Document Assembly Enhancements

This section provides detailed instructions for completely redesigning the document assembly system in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These enhancements will create a robust, memory-efficient document assembly system capable of handling documents of any size.

3. [Memory-Efficient Algorithms](./03-efficient-algorithms.md)
4. [Testing Document Assembly](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current document assembly system loads all chunks into memory, which can lead to out-of-memory errors with large documents. The enhanced system will:

1. Completely redesign the document assembly process for better memory efficiency
2. Implement lazy loading of chunks during assembly
3. Use memory-efficient algorithms for text processing
4. Include comprehensive testing to ensure reliability

By implementing these enhancements, we can create a document assembly system that scales with document size and complexity, without running into memory limitations.

## Implementation Timeline

These enhancements should take approximately 1-2 weeks to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these enhancements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the immediate fixes and short-term improvements
2. A thorough understanding of memory-efficient text processing
3. Familiarity with advanced JavaScript/TypeScript patterns like streams and generators
4. Experience with large-scale text processing applications
