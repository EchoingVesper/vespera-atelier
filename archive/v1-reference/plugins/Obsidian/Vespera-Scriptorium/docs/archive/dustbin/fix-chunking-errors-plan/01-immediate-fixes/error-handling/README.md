# Error Handling

This section provides detailed instructions for implementing robust error handling in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These measures will help prevent crashes and provide users with informative feedback when errors occur.

## Overview

The error logs indicate that the plugin is experiencing crashes during document processing, particularly when memory issues occur. By implementing robust error handling, we can:

1. Prevent the plugin from crashing when errors occur
2. Provide clear feedback to users about what went wrong
3. Recover gracefully from errors when possible
4. Save partial results to avoid losing work

These measures will improve the user experience and make the plugin more reliable, even when processing complex documents or running into resource limitations.

## Implementation Timeline

These fixes should take approximately 4-6 hours to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these fixes, ensure you have:

1. A local development environment set up for the Vespera Scriptorium plugin
2. Understanding of TypeScript and JavaScript error handling
3. Access to the plugin's codebase, particularly the files containing the document processing logic
