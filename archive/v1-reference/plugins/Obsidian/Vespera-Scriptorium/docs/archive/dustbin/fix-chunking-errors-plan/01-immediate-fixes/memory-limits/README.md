# Memory Limits

This section provides detailed instructions for implementing basic memory limits in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These measures will help prevent out-of-memory errors during document processing.

3. [Implementing Memory Checks](./03-memory-checks.md)
4. [Testing Memory Limits](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The error logs indicate that the plugin is experiencing memory issues during document processing, particularly when handling large documents. By implementing basic memory monitoring and limits, we can prevent the plugin from consuming excessive memory and crashing.

The implementations in this section will:

1. Add monitoring to track memory usage during document processing
2. Establish thresholds for acceptable memory usage
3. Implement checks to prevent processing when memory usage is too high
4. Add user notifications when memory limits are reached

These measures will provide an immediate safeguard against memory-related crashes while more comprehensive solutions are developed.

## Implementation Timeline

These fixes should take approximately 4-6 hours to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these fixes, ensure you have:

1. A local development environment set up for the Vespera Scriptorium plugin
2. Understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript memory management
3. Access to the plugin's codebase, particularly the files containing the document processing logic
