# Immediate Fixes for Chunking Errors

This section outlines the immediate fixes needed to address critical issues in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These fixes are designed to be implemented quickly to stabilize the plugin and prevent crashes.

## Implementation Approach

These fixes should be implemented in the following order:

1. First, fix the sortChunksByPosition function to handle missing IDs gracefully
2. Next, implement basic memory monitoring and limits
3. Finally, add error handling to prevent crashes

Each fix should be tested individually before proceeding to the next. The entire set of immediate fixes should take approximately 1-2 days to implement and test.

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these immediate fixes:

- The plugin should no longer crash when processing documents with missing chunk IDs
- The plugin should gracefully handle memory-intensive operations
- Users should receive clear notifications when errors occur during processing

These fixes will stabilize the plugin while more comprehensive solutions are developed in the short-term and long-term phases.
