# Default Configuration Provider

**Architectural Role:** The Default Configuration Provider is responsible for defining and providing the default configuration settings for the plugin. These defaults are used when no user-specific configuration is found or when certain settings are not explicitly set by the user.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` constant in `src/SettingsManager.ts` serves as the default configuration provider.

*   **Implementation:** The `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` constant is an object that defines the default values for all plugin settings. This object is used by the `SettingsManager` when loading settings to provide fallback values.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Default Configuration Provider" is not a distinct component but a constant within the `SettingsManager`. While functional, formalizing this as a dedicated component could be considered for larger or more complex default configurations, although the current approach is reasonable for the current scope.
    *   There is no mechanism for dynamically loading or generating default configurations based on the environment or other factors.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Review if formalizing the Default Configuration Provider as a dedicated component is necessary based on future complexity or requirements.
*   [ ] If formalized, define how the Default Configuration Provider is structured and accessed.
*   [ ] Document the Default Configuration Provider's role and the structure of the default settings.
