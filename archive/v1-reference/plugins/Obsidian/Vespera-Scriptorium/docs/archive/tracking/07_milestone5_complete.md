# Milestone 5 Complete: LLM Orchestration & Summarization

## Overview
Milestone 5 focused on implementing LLM integration for the Vespera-Scriptorium plugin. This milestone has been successfully completed with all requirements implemented, including LLM client functionality, provider implementations for Ollama and LM Studio, prompt template system, settings integration, and progress visualization.

## Accomplishments

### LLM Integration
- ✅ Implemented LLMClient module with robust error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Created provider implementations for Ollama and LM Studio
- ✅ Added support for both CLI and HTTP interfaces
- ✅ Implemented streaming support for real-time feedback
- ✅ Added token counting and usage tracking
- ✅ Integrated with Chunker module for processing text chunks

### Prompt Template System
- ✅ Implemented PromptTemplateManager for flexible template management
- ✅ Added variable substitution and conditional sections in templates
- ✅ Created default templates for different summarization tasks
- ✅ Implemented template registration and retrieval system
- ✅ Added support for custom user templates

### Settings & UI
- ✅ Added LLM configuration options in settings panel
- ✅ Implemented model detection and capability reporting
- ✅ Created ProgressPane for visualizing processing status
- ✅ Added error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- ✅ Implemented cancellation support for long-running operations

## Technical Details

### LLM Client Architecture
The LLMClient module provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM providers:
1. Abstract LLMProvider interface defines common operations
2. Provider-specific implementations handle communication details
3. Factory pattern creates appropriate provider instances
4. Retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient errors
5. Streaming implementation processes chunks in real-time

### Provider Implementations
- **Ollama Provider**: Communicates with Ollama API for model listing, completion generation, and token counting
- **LM Studio Provider**: Uses OpenAI-compatible API endpoints for interacting with LM Studio

### Prompt Template System
The PromptTemplateManager provides:
1. Template registration and retrieval
2. Variable substitution with {{variable}} syntax
3. Conditional sections with {{#if variable}}...{{else}}...{{/if}} syntax
4. Default templates for common summarization tasks
5. Integration with LLMClient for easy template application

### Progress Visualization
The ProgressPane component:
1. Displays a progress bar for long-running operations
2. Shows status messages and error feedback
3. Provides cancellation capability
4. Updates in real-time as processing progresses
5. Integrates with Obsidian's UI system

## Next Steps
With Milestone 5 complete, the project is ready to move on to Milestone 6: "Output Writing & Summaries Folder", which will focus on:

1. Implementing the Writer module to create summary files
2. Creating a `/Summaries` folder structure for organized output
3. Implementing proper file naming and formatting for summaries
4. Adding metadata to summaries (original file, date, model used)
5. Handling file overwrites and conflicts
6. Ensuring proper error handling for file operations

This will complete the end-to-end workflow from file selection to summarization to output writing, bringing the plugin to a functional state for user testing.
