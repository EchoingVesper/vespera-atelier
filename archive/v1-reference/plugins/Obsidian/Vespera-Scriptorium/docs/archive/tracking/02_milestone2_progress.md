# Milestone 2 Progress: File Discovery & UI Modal

**Date:** 2025-04-29

## Completed (so far)

- Ribbon icon: Custom SVG (quill/scroll) now appears in the sidebar, sized and colored via CSS to match Obsidian theme; hover effect implemented.
- FileManager file discovery utility implemented and unit-tested (mock vault).
- MultiSelectModal UI component stub created in `/src/UI` (not yet integrated or functional).

## In Progress / Next Steps

- Integrate modal with FileManager and register plugin command.
- Implement selection UI, keyboard navigation, and accessibility features.
- Make modal display eligible files and pass selection to next workflow step.
- Update docs/modules/FileManager.md and UI.md with implementation notes.

## UI Modal Progress (April 29, 2025)

- Modal layout now includes:
  - Treeview with keyboard/mouse selection (Space, Enter, right-click, arrows)
  - Settings gear overlay (keyboard accessible)
  - Confirm/Cancel/Clear button group (single tab stop, arrow navigation)
  - Prompt input area: multiline textarea, full-width
  - Saved prompts dropdown (expands to cover checkbox on open)
  - Checkbox to "Save current prompt?" (visual only for now)
- All elements are accessible by keyboard and visually aligned for clarity.
- CSS and structure revised for responsive layout and modal resizing.

### For Next Time
- Begin wiring up modal components:
  - Hook up prompt input to internal state and confirm action
  - Implement logic for the retain prompt checkbox
  - Connect saved prompts dropdown to actual storage (and editing via gear/settings)
  - Wire up Confirm to return selected files and prompt
- Review and improve ARIA roles and accessibility further if needed.

## Notes

- Node.js fs logic is now used only in tests/mocks; plugin code is Vault API-compliant.
- Progress aligns with ImplementationPlan.md and Obsidian plugin guidelines.
