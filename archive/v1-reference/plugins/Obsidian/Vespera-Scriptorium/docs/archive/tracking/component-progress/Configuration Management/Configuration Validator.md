# Configuration Validator

**Architectural Role:** The Configuration Validator is responsible for ensuring that the loaded configuration settings are valid and adhere to the expected structure and constraints. It checks for missing required settings, incorrect data types, or values outside of acceptable ranges. This prevents the system from operating with invalid configurations that could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory and `SettingsManager.ts`, explicit configuration validation against a schema is not clearly implemented within a dedicated component.

*   **Implementation:** The `SettingsManager`'s `loadSettings` method merges loaded settings with default settings, which provides some level of handling for missing values. However, it doesn't appear to perform comprehensive validation of data types or value constraints.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Configuration Validator" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A centralized and robust mechanism for validating the entire configuration structure and values is missing.
    *   Defining a schema or set of rules for configuration validation is required.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design a schema or set of rules for validating the plugin's configuration settings.
*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Configuration Validator".
*   [ ] Implement logic for validating the configuration object against the defined schema/rules.
*   [ ] Define how validation errors are reported.
*   [ ] Ensure the Configuration Loader and Settings Manager utilize the Configuration Validator during configuration loading and updating.
*   [ ] Document the Configuration Validator's role, validation rules, and implementation details.
