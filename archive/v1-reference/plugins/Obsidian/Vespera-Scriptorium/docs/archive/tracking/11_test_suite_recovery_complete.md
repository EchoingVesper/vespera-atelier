# Milestone: Test Suite Recovery (May 2025)

## Overview
This milestone represents the successful recovery of the Vespera Scriptorium test suite, addressing critical issues with timeout handling, file naming, chunk sorting, and logging.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Provider Stubs for LLMClient
- Implemented minimal provider stubs for OllamaProvider and LMStudioProvider
- Enabled LLMClient tests to run without actual provider dependencies
- Created proper dependency injection patterns for testing

### 2. Enhanced Obsidian Vault Mocks
- Extended mock implementations to cover all required Vault API methods
- Implemented in-memory file operations for testing
- Prevented real file I/O during test execution

### 3. Per-chunk Timeout Enforcement
- Implemented individual timeout handling for each content chunk
- Added retry mechanisms for timed-out chunks
- Created progressive timeout calculation based on chunk size

### 4. Incremental Output File Naming
- Implemented automatic sequential naming for output files
- Added checks for existing files to prevent overwrites
- Enhanced logging to record actual output filenames

### 5. Defensive Chunk Sorting
- Fixed issues with localeCompare and added defensive checks
- Implemented fallbacks for missing or malformed metadata
- Added logging for sorting errors and warnings

### 6. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging for output filenames, chunk lifecycle, and configuration
- Implemented log level controls for different environments
- Improved error logging for better debugging

## Impact
- All tests now pass consistently
- System is more robust against hardware limitations
- Error handling is comprehensive and informative
- Documentation reflects actual system behavior

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring test stability
- Consider additional performance optimizations
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
