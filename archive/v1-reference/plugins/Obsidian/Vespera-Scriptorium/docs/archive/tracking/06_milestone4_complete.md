# Milestone 4 Complete: Text Chunking & Settings

## Overview
Milestone 4 focused on implementing the text chunking functionality and exposing related settings to users. This milestone has been successfully completed with all requirements implemented.

## Accomplishments

### Implementation
- ✅ Installed LangChain.js dependency for advanced text splitting
- ✅ Implemented RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter in Chunker module
- ✅ Added token counting functionality via LangChain
- ✅ Implemented chunk overlap logic with configurable parameters
- ✅ Updated Chunker unit tests to verify functionality
- ✅ Integrated Chunker module with the main workflow

### Settings Integration
- ✅ Exposed chunk size/overlap settings in UI with sliders
- ✅ Added model context window size setting (1000-32000 tokens)
- ✅ Implemented settings persistence through SettingsManager
- ✅ Added validation for chunking parameters

### Documentation
- ✅ Documented chunking algorithm in Chunker.md
- ✅ Updated Chunker module documentation with usage examples
- ✅ Added user-facing documentation for chunking settings

## Technical Details

### Chunking Algorithm
The implementation uses LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter which:
1. Attempts to split text at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences, etc.)
2. Recursively splits chunks that exceed the target size
3. Maintains specified overlap between chunks to preserve context

### Settings
- **Model Context Window**: User-configurable setting (1000-32000 tokens) to match their LLM's capabilities
- **Chunk Size**: Configurable from 100-8000 tokens with 100-token increments
- **Chunk Overlap**: Configurable from 0-500 tokens with 10-token increments

### Integration
The Chunker module is now fully integrated with the main workflow:
1. Files are selected via the MultiSelectModal
2. Selected files are parsed by the Parser module
3. Parsed content is passed to the Chunker module
4. Text is split into chunks based on user settings
5. Chunks are prepared for the next milestone (LLM processing)

## Next Steps
With Milestone 4 complete, the project is ready to move on to Milestone 5: "LLM Orchestration & Summarization", which will focus on integrating with local LLMs (Ollama/LM Studio) to process the text chunks.
