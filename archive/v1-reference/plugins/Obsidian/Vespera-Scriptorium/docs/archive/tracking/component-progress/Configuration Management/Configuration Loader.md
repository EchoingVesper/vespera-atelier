# Configuration Loader

**Architectural Role:** The Configuration Loader is responsible for loading the plugin's configuration settings from a persistent source (e.g., a settings file). It reads the configuration data, validates it, and makes it available to other components in the system.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `SettingsManager` class in `src/SettingsManager.ts` implements the core functionality for loading settings, acting as a Configuration Loader.

*   **Implementation:** The `SettingsManager`'s `loadSettings` method reads the settings from a JSON file (`vespera-scriptorium-settings.json`) within the Obsidian vault. It merges the loaded settings with default settings and handles potential file not found or parsing errors.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Configuration Loader" is not a distinct component but rather part of the `SettingsManager`. Separating this logic would improve modularity and allow for loading configuration from different sources if needed in the future.
    *   While basic error handling for loading is present, explicit configuration validation against a schema is not clearly implemented within this loading process.
    *   The current implementation is tied to loading from a specific JSON file in the vault.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Configuration Loader".
*   [ ] Define how the Configuration Loader receives the path or source of the configuration.
*   [ ] Implement logic for reading configuration data from different potential sources (e.g., file, environment variables).
*   [ ] Integrate with a dedicated "Configuration Validator" component to ensure the loaded configuration is valid.
*   [ ] Document the Configuration Loader's role, supported sources, and implementation details.
