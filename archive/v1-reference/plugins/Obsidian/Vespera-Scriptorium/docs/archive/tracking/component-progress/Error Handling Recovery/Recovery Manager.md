# Recovery Manager

**Architectural Role:** The Recovery Manager is responsible for coordinating and executing recovery strategies when errors occur during workflow execution. This can involve utilizing checkpoints to resume processing from a known good state, implementing alternative processing paths, or applying other recovery mechanisms to minimize data loss and ensure the workflow can complete.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `ProcessingOrchestrator` class in `src/robust-processing/ProcessingOrchestrator.ts` contains logic related to resuming processing from a checkpoint, which is a form of recovery management.

*   **Implementation:** The `resumeProcessing` method in `ProcessingOrchestrator` loads a checkpoint using the `PersistenceManager` and attempts to continue processing from the point where the workflow was paused or interrupted. This includes identifying pending chunks and utilizing partial results.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Recovery Manager" is not a distinct, centralized component. The recovery logic is embedded within the `ProcessingOrchestrator` and is specific to resuming from checkpoints.
    *   A generic mechanism for defining and executing various recovery strategies based on different error types or workflow states is missing.
    *   Integration with the "Error Handler" to trigger specific recovery actions based on detected errors is needed.
    *   More advanced recovery strategies (e.g., skipping failed items, attempting alternative processing methods) are not clearly implemented.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Recovery Manager".
*   [ ] Define how the Recovery Manager receives error information and workflow state.
*   [ ] Implement a mechanism for defining and executing different recovery strategies.
*   [ ] Ensure the Recovery Manager can interact with the "Checkpointing" and "Retry Mechanism" components.
*   [ ] Document the Recovery Manager's role, supported recovery strategies, and implementation details.
