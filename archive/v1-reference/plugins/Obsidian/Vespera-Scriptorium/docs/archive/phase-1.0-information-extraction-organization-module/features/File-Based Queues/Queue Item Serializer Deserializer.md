# Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer

**Architectural Role:** The Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer is responsible for converting queue items into a format suitable for storage in the file-based queues (serialization) and converting them back into usable data structures when read from the queues (deserialization). This ensures that complex data types can be correctly stored and retrieved from the file system.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory and the `PersistenceManager`, there is no explicit implementation of a dedicated "Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer" component.

*   **Implementation:** The `PersistenceManager` uses `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for serializing and deserializing `ProcessingCheckpoint` objects and partial results. This handles the basic serialization needs for the current persistence mechanism. However, a dedicated component for handling various data types or more complex serialization/deserialization logic for generic queue items is not present.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   A dedicated "Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   The existing serialization/deserialization is basic JSON handling within the `PersistenceManager`, not a flexible component for various queue item types.
    *   Mechanisms for handling different data formats or more efficient serialization methods for potentially large queue items are not defined.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer".
*   [ ] Define interfaces for serialization and deserialization methods that can handle various data types.
*   [ ] Consider supporting different serialization formats (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers, etc.) based on performance and data complexity needs.
*   [ ] Integrate the Serializer/Deserializer with the Queue Reader and Queue Writer components.
*   [ ] Document the Queue Item Serializer/Deserializer's role, supported formats, and implementation details.
