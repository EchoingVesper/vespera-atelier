# Output Writer

**Architectural Role:** The Output Writer is responsible for writing the generated output content to the specified destination(s). It interacts with the underlying file system or other output targets to save the final processed document in the desired format and location.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `saveOutput` method within the `OutputManager` class (`src/robust-processing/OutputManager.ts`) implements the core functionality for writing output files.

*   **Implementation:** The `saveOutput` method takes an `AssembledDocument` and `OutputOptions`, generates the output content (using internal methods), and then uses the Obsidian vault adapter (`this.app.vault.adapter.write`) to write the content to the specified `targetLocation` and `filenameTemplate`. It also handles ensuring the target directory exists.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Output Writer" is not a distinct component but rather part of the `OutputManager`. Separating this logic would improve modularity and allow for easier implementation of different output destinations.
    *   The current implementation is tied to writing files within the Obsidian vault using the adapter. A dedicated component could abstract this to support writing to other locations (e.g., external file paths, network locations).
    *   Integration with a dedicated "Output Destination Manager" would be necessary to handle various output targets.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Output Writer".
*   [ ] Define how the Output Writer receives the generated output content and destination information.
*   [ ] Implement logic for writing the content to the specified target, abstracting the underlying file system or network operations.
*   [ ] Ensure the Output Writer integrates with a dedicated "Output Destination Manager".
*   [ ] Document the Output Writer's role, supported destinations, and implementation details.
