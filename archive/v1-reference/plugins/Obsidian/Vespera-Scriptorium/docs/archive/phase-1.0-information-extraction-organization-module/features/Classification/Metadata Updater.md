# Metadata Updater

**Architectural Role:** The Metadata Updater is responsible for incorporating classification results and other generated metadata back into the original document or associated metadata stores. This ensures that the classification information is persistently linked to the document and available for future use (e.g., searching, filtering, or further processing).

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of a "Metadata Updater" component.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated class or module specifically responsible for updating document metadata with classification results or other generated information.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Metadata Updater" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for writing classification results and other generated metadata back to the original document or a separate metadata store is missing.
    *   Integration with the Obsidian API for modifying file metadata or frontmatter is required.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Metadata Updater".
*   [ ] Define how the Metadata Updater receives classification results and other metadata to be updated.
*   [ ] Implement logic for updating document metadata, potentially supporting different methods (e.g., modifying frontmatter, adding inline fields).
*   [ ] Ensure the Metadata Updater interacts correctly with the Obsidian API for file modifications.
*   [ ] Document the Metadata Updater's role, how it updates metadata, and its implementation details.
