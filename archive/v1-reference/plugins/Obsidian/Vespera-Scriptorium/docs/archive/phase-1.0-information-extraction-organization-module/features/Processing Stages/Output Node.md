# Output Node

**Architectural Role:** The Output Node is the final stage in the document processing workflow. Its primary function is to take the processed results (either consolidated or from individual chunks) and generate the final output in various formats. This includes applying templates, structuring the output, and writing the results to the desired destination.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `src/robust-processing/OutputManager.ts` file implements the core functionality for generating and saving output, aligning well with the role of the Output Node.

*   **Implementation:** The `OutputManager` class provides methods for saving output in different formats (Markdown, HTML, Text, JSON), consolidating or segmenting the output, applying format-specific templates, and managing output history. It interacts with the Obsidian vault adapter to write the output files.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Output Node" is not explicitly defined as a distinct node type within a workflow framework. Its functionality is encapsulated within the `OutputManager` class. Formalizing it as a node would fit the decomposed architecture better.
    *   The `OutputManager` currently handles both the generation of the output content and the writing of the files. While related, these could potentially be separated into "Output Generator" and "Output Writer" subcomponents as per the decomposition for increased modularity.
    *   The concept of "Output Templates" is present in the `formatTemplates` property, but a dedicated "Output Templates" component for managing and potentially customizing these templates is not explicitly defined.
    *   A dedicated "Output Destination Manager" for handling various output targets beyond the Obsidian vault (e.g., external files, APIs) is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Define the "Output Node" as a distinct node type within the processing workflow framework. (`src/robust-processing/OutputNode.ts` created as a specialized `ProcessingNode`).
*   [ ] Consider separating the output generation logic from the file writing logic into distinct "Output Generator" and "Output Writer" components.
*   [ ] Create a dedicated "Output Templates" component for managing and potentially allowing customization of output templates.
*   [ ] Implement an "Output Destination Manager" to handle writing output to various targets beyond the Obsidian vault.
*   [ ] Document the Output Node's role, configuration, supported formats, and implementation clearly.
