# Decision Node

**Architectural Role:** The Decision Node is a processing stage that introduces conditional logic into the workflow. It evaluates the output or state from a previous node and, based on predefined rules or criteria, determines the subsequent path or action in the processing workflow. This allows for dynamic workflows that can adapt based on the characteristics or results of processing.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of `src/robust-processing/ProcessingOrchestrator.ts`, there is no explicit implementation of a "Decision Node" as a distinct component or processing stage that directs workflow based on the results of previous steps.

*   **Implementation:** The `ProcessingOrchestrator` contains logic for handling cancellation (`this.isCancelled`) and pausing (`this.isPaused`) within the `processDocument` method. These checks influence whether the processing continues or stops, which is a form of flow control. However, this is not the same as a node that evaluates processing results (e.g., classification output, extraction confidence) to decide the next step in a dynamic workflow.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Decision Node" as described in the architectural decomposition is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   There is no mechanism for defining conditional transitions between processing stages based on the outcome of a node's execution.
    *   The existing flow control (cancellation/pausing) is embedded within the orchestrator rather than being a pluggable node type.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Decision Node".
*   [ ] Define how Decision Nodes receive input from previous nodes and evaluate conditions.
*   [ ] Establish a mechanism for defining rules or criteria that the Decision Node uses to make decisions.
*   [ ] Implement the logic for directing the workflow to different subsequent nodes based on the decision outcome.
*   [ ] Integrate Decision Nodes into the workflow execution engine (Workflow Orchestrator).
*   [ ] Document the Decision Node's role, configuration, and how it enables dynamic workflows.
