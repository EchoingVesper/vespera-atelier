# Metadata Extractor

**Status:** Implemented
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

**Architectural Role:** The Metadata Extractor is responsible for extracting relevant metadata from ingested documents. This can include information such as the document title, author, creation date, modification date, and potentially other structured or unstructured metadata embedded within the document or its file system properties. This metadata is used for various purposes, including organizing processed output and providing context to processing nodes.

**Codebase Comparison Findings (Pre-Scaffolding):**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there was no explicit implementation of a dedicated "Metadata Extractor" component. Metadata extraction appeared to be handled implicitly or as part of other processes, rather than as a distinct, pluggable component.

*   **Implementation (Pre-Scaffolding):** There was no dedicated class or module specifically responsible for extracting metadata from various document types. The logic for obtaining basic metadata (like document name or path) was likely embedded within the ingestion or processing initiation logic.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates (Pre-Scaffolding):**
    *   The "Metadata Extractor" component was not implemented in the current codebase as a distinct architectural component.
    *   A centralized and extensible mechanism for extracting metadata from different document formats was missing.
    *   The ability to define and extract custom metadata based on configuration or document content was not present.

**Development Log:**
*   **2025-05-20:** Basic class structure `MetadataExtractor.ts` created in `src/ingestion/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
*   **2025-05-20:** Implemented full functionality including file system metadata extraction, content-based metadata extraction, and format-specific handling. Status updated to Implemented.

**Implementation Details:**

The Metadata Extractor has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Environment Adaptability:**
   * Works in both Obsidian environment (using Vault API) and standalone Node.js environment
   * Automatically detects the environment and uses appropriate APIs

2. **File System Metadata Extraction:**
   * Extracts creation date, modification date, file size
   * Determines file extension and MIME type
   * Handles path parsing and normalization

3. **Content-Based Metadata Extraction:**
   * Extracts frontmatter from Markdown files (YAML format)
   * Parses JSON metadata from JSON files
   * Extracts tags from content (e.g., #tag format)
   * Supports custom metadata extraction for specific file types

4. **Error Handling:**
   * Graceful degradation when metadata cannot be extracted
   * Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
   * Returns partial metadata even when some extraction fails

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Metadata Extractor". (`src/ingestion/MetadataExtractor.ts` created)
*   [x] Define how the Metadata Extractor handles different document types and formats.
*   [x] Implement logic for extracting standard and potentially custom metadata.
*   [x] Ensure the extracted metadata is structured and made available to subsequent processing stages and the output generation.
*   [x] Document the Metadata Extractor's role, supported metadata types, and implementation details.
