# Queue Writer

**Architectural Role:** The Queue Writer is responsible for adding items to the file-based queues. It interacts with the persistence layer to write new items to the appropriate queue file(s), ensuring data is correctly formatted and stored for later consumption by Queue Readers.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of a "Queue Writer" component that adds items to file-based queues.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated class or module responsible for writing items to file-based queues. The concept of writing to a queue as described in the architectural decomposition does not appear to be implemented.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Queue Writer" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for adding items to file-based queues is missing.
    *   Functionality for ensuring data integrity and proper formatting of items when writing to the queue is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Queue Writer".
*   [ ] Define how the Queue Writer interacts with the persistence layer to add queue items.
*   [ ] Implement logic for writing items to the appropriate queue file(s).
*   [ ] Ensure data integrity and proper formatting of queue items during writing.
*   [ ] Document the Queue Writer's role, responsibilities, and API.
