# Merge Node

**Architectural Role:** The Merge Node is a processing stage responsible for combining results from multiple preceding nodes or processed chunks into a unified output. This typically involves tasks such as assembling processed chunks in the correct order, resolving dependencies or references between combined pieces, handling overlaps or redundancies, and ensuring overall coherence of the final output.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `src/robust-processing/DocumentAssembler.ts` file implements the core functionality for merging processed chunks, aligning well with the role of the Merge Node.

*   **Implementation:** The `DocumentAssembler` class provides the `assembleDocument` method, which takes an array of `ChunkResult` objects and combines their content. It includes logic for sorting chunks, assembling content (with or without boundaries), resolving internal references, detecting and removing redundant sections, and optimizing for coherence.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Merge Node" is implemented as the `DocumentAssembler` class, which is used by the `ProcessingOrchestrator`, rather than being a distinct, pluggable node type within a workflow framework. Formalizing it as a node would improve modularity and flexibility.
    *   The `DocumentAssembler` currently encompasses several distinct sub-tasks (sorting, assembly, redundancy detection, coherence optimization). While logical, these could potentially be further decomposed into smaller, more focused components if needed for greater modularity or testability.
    *   The current implementation primarily focuses on merging processed text chunks. Its role might need to be expanded to handle merging different types of data or outputs from various node types in a more generic workflow.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Define the "Merge Node" as a distinct node type within the processing workflow framework.
*   [ ] Ensure the Merge Node utilizes the `DocumentAssembler` (or its refactored parts) to perform the merging logic.
*   [ ] Review the internal structure of `DocumentAssembler` for potential further decomposition into sub-components like "Redundancy Detector" or "Coherence Optimizer" if beneficial for modularity.
*   [ ] Consider how the Merge Node would handle merging outputs from different types of processing nodes if the workflow architecture expands.
*   [ ] Document the Merge Node's role, configuration, and implementation clearly.
