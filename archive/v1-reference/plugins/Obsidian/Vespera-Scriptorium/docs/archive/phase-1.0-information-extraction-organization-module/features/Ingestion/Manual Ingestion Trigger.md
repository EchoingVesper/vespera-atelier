# Manual Ingestion Trigger

**Status:** Implemented
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

**Architectural Role:** The Manual Ingestion Trigger provides a user-initiated mechanism to start the ingestion process for a specific document or set of documents. This allows users to manually select files for processing, bypassing or supplementing the automatic file watching mechanism.

**Codebase Comparison Findings (Pre-Scaffolding):**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there was no explicit implementation of a dedicated "Manual Ingestion Trigger" component. The initiation of document processing appeared to be handled directly within the UI or command handling logic, rather than through a distinct trigger component.

*   **Implementation (Pre-Scaffolding):** There was no dedicated class or module specifically responsible for handling manual ingestion requests and initiating the ingestion process. The logic for starting processing was likely embedded within UI event handlers or command implementations.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates (Pre-Scaffolding):**
    *   The "Manual Ingestion Trigger" component was not implemented in the current codebase as a distinct architectural component.
    *   A clear, centralized mechanism for initiating ingestion based on user actions was missing.
    *   Decoupling the ingestion initiation logic from UI or command handling would improve modularity.

**Development Log:**
*   **2025-05-20:** Basic class structure `ManualIngestionTrigger.ts` created in `src/ingestion/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
*   **2025-05-20:** Implemented full functionality including file selection, batch processing, and notification system. Status updated to Implemented.

**Implementation Details:**

The Manual Ingestion Trigger has been implemented with the following features:

1. **User Input Handling:**
   * Accepts single file paths or arrays of file paths
   * Supports file selection through UI integration
   * Provides methods for programmatic triggering from other components

2. **Ingestion Process Initiation:**
   * Interacts with the Ingestion Processor to start processing
   * Supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes
   * Provides feedback on ingestion status through a notification system

3. **Batch Processing:**
   * Handles multiple files efficiently
   * Reports individual success/failure for each file
   * Provides aggregate statistics on batch processing results

4. **Error Handling:**
   * Robust error handling for invalid file paths
   * Clear user feedback on processing failures
   * Detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Manual Ingestion Trigger". (`src/ingestion/ManualIngestionTrigger.ts` created)
*   [x] Define how the trigger receives input (e.g., file paths) from user interactions.
*   [x] Implement logic for initiating the ingestion process based on manual triggers.
*   [x] Ensure the trigger interacts with the Ingestion Processor to start the ingestion workflow.
*   [x] Document the Manual Ingestion Trigger's role, how it's activated, and its implementation details.
