# File Watcher

**Status:** Implemented
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

**Architectural Role:** The File Watcher is responsible for monitoring specified directories or files for changes (e.g., new files, modifications, deletions). When changes are detected, it triggers the ingestion process for the affected documents. This enables automatic processing of new or updated content.

**Codebase Comparison Findings (Pre-Scaffolding):**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there was no explicit implementation of a "File Watcher" component.

*   **Implementation (Pre-Scaffolding):** There was no dedicated class or module responsible for monitoring the file system for changes. The current ingestion process (if any exists outside of manual triggers) was not driven by file system events.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates (Pre-Scaffolding):**
    *   The "File Watcher" component was not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for automatically detecting new or changed files in designated ingestion directories was missing.
    *   Integration with the operating system's file watching capabilities or a similar library was required.

**Development Log:**
*   **2025-05-20:** Basic class structure `FileWatcher.ts` created in `src/ingestion/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
*   **2025-05-20:** Implemented full functionality including path configuration, event detection, and ingestion triggering. Status updated to Implemented.

**Implementation Details:**

The File Watcher has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Path Configuration:**
   * Supports watching multiple paths simultaneously
   * Configurable file extensions to watch
   * Ability to include or exclude specific patterns

2. **Event Detection:**
   * Monitors file creation, modification, and deletion events
   * Uses Obsidian's vault events when running in Obsidian
   * Falls back to Node.js fs.watch API when running standalone

3. **Ingestion Triggering:**
   * Calls the Ingestion Processor when relevant file events are detected
   * Debounces events to prevent duplicate processing
   * Provides file path and event type to the processor

4. **Error Handling:**
   * Robust error handling for file system access issues
   * Graceful recovery from temporary file system unavailability
   * Detailed logging of watch events and errors

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "File Watcher". (`src/ingestion/FileWatcher.ts` created)
*   [x] Define how the File Watcher is configured to monitor specific paths.
*   [x] Implement logic for detecting file system events (creation, modification, deletion).
*   [x] Define how the File Watcher triggers the ingestion process for affected files.
*   [x] Document the File Watcher's role, configuration, and implementation details.
