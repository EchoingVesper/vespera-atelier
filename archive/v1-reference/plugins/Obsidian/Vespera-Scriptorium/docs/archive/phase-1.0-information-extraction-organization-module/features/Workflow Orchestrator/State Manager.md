# State Manager

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Last Updated**: May 20, 2025
- **Architectural Role**: Manages and persists the state of workflows and their nodes during execution.

## Development Log

- **May 20, 2025**: Basic class structure `StateManager.ts` created in `src/workflow-orchestrator/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
- **May 20, 2025**: Refactored `StateManager.ts` to use the shared `WorkflowState` type from `types.ts`. Implemented basic CRUD operations with a file-based persistence strategy using Obsidian's `DataAdapter`. Added `uuid` for generating instance IDs and custom error classes (`StateNotFoundError`, `StatePersistenceError`). Constructor now accepts `DataAdapter` and a `basePath` for storing state files.

## Checklist for Updates

- [x] Design and implement the `StateManager` class. (Core structure and CRUD methods implemented)
- [x] Define the `IWorkflowState` interface comprehensively. (Utilizing existing `WorkflowState` from `src/workflow-orchestrator/types.ts`)
- [x] Implement methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting workflow state. (Implemented for file-based persistence)
- [x] Design a strategy for state persistence (e.g., in-memory, file-based, database). (File-based strategy chosen and basic implementation done)
- [x] Implement chosen persistence mechanism. (Basic file I/O using `DataAdapter` implemented)
- [ ] Ensure atomicity and consistency for state operations, especially in concurrent scenarios. (Further review needed)
- [x] Add error handling for state operations (e.g., state not found, persistence errors). (Custom error classes and basic handling implemented)
- [ ] Write unit tests for state lifecycle and persistence.
- [ ] Document the state management strategy and API. (Method signatures updated in code comments)
