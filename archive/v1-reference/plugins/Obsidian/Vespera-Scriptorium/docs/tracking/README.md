# Documentation Tracking Overview

This directory, `docs/tracking`, centralizes all development tracking for the Vespera Scriptorium Obsidian plugin. Our current development efforts are laser-focused on the **"1.0" release**, which is defined by the completion and stabilization of the **Information Extraction and Organization Module**.

## New Directory Structure

To reflect this focus, the tracking documentation has been reorganized as follows:

* **[`information-extraction-organization-module-1.0/`](./information-extraction-organization-module-1.0/)**: This is the primary directory for all active tracking related to the "Information Extraction and Organization Module" and its progress towards the 1.0 milestone.
* **[`security/`](./security/)**: Dedicated tracking for security issues, vulnerability reports, and security updates. See [Security Tracking README](./security/README.md) for details.
* **[`archive/`](./archive/)**: This directory contains older planning documents, tracking for superseded features, or completed efforts not directly tied to the current 1.0 module development.

## The Information Extraction and Organization Module (Version 1.0)

The "Information Extraction and Organization Module" is the cornerstone of the Vespera Scriptorium plugin's upcoming 1.0 release. It represents a significant evolution of the previous "Summarization Module," expanding its capabilities into a comprehensive solution for knowledge processing.

### Scope and Purpose

(Details to be filled in the module's own README)

## Plugin 1.0 Release Milestone

**Crucially, the "1.0" milestone for the Information Extraction and Organization Module will define the official "1.0" release of the Vespera Scriptorium plugin.**

## Developer Guidance

* **For current 1.0 progress tracking**: Refer to [`information-extraction-organization-module-1.0/README.md`](./phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/README.md).
* **For security issues and updates**: Consult the [`security/`](./security/) directory and its [README](./security/README.md).
* **For archived or previous planning materials**: Consult the [`archive/`](./archive/) directory.
