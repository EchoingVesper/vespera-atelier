# Phase-1.0-Protocol-Based-Architecture-Orchestration-Agent-Development-prompt.md

**Objective:**
Develop the Orchestration Agent responsible for coordinating workflows, managing task execution, and ensuring reliable operation of the agent ecosystem within the Protocol-Based Architecture.

**Context:**
* **Project Phase:** `1.0`
* **Module Focus:** `Protocol-Based Architecture - Orchestration Agent`
* **Task Tracking Location:** `docs/tracking/phase-1.0-protocol-based-architecture/agent-definitions/orchestration-agent/CHECKLISTS.md`
* **Git Branch:** `1.0-protocol-architecture` (or adapt based on project conventions)

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify Next Task:**
   a. Review the Orchestration Agent checklist
   b. Identify the first uncompleted task in the highest priority section (P0)
   c. Log the task details including its description and source location

2. **Design & Planning:**
   a. Design the workflow DSL (Domain Specific Language)
   b. Plan the task scheduling and coordination system
   c. Design the state management and persistence layer
   d. Plan error handling and recovery mechanisms
   e. Design the monitoring and alerting system

3. **Implementation:**
   a. Implement the workflow engine core
   b. Create the task scheduler and executor
   c. Develop state persistence and recovery
   d. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   e. Add monitoring and metrics collection

4. **Integration:**
   a. Connect to MCP for model-based decision making
   b. Integrate with A2A for agent communication
   c. Implement service discovery for dynamic agent registration
   d. Add health check and status endpoints

5. **Testing:**
   a. Unit tests for workflow execution
   b. Integration tests with other agents
   c. Failure scenario testing
   d. Performance testing with concurrent workflows
   e. Recovery testing from failures

6. **Documentation:**
   a. Document the workflow DSL
   b. Create developer guides for workflow creation
   c. Document configuration options
   d. Add code comments and JSDoc

**Key Requirements:**
* **Reliability:** Ensure workflow completion even with failures
* **Scalability:** Handle thousands of concurrent workflows
* **Observability:** Detailed monitoring of workflow execution
* **Extensibility:** Easy to add new workflow steps
* **Security:** Secure access control for workflow operations

**Technical Stack:**
* Language: TypeScript/Node.js
* Dependencies:
  - MCP client library
  - A2A communication library
  - Workflow engine libraries
  - State management libraries

**Error Handling:**
* Workflow-level error boundaries
* Automatic retry with backoff
* Manual intervention points
* Detailed error reporting and logging

**Performance Considerations:**
* Efficient workflow state serialization
* Horizontal scaling support
* Workflow prioritization
* Resource allocation and throttling

**Security Considerations:**
* Authentication and authorization
* Secure storage of workflow state
* Input validation and sanitization
* Audit logging of workflow operations
