# Phase-1.0-Protocol-Based-Architecture-Processing-Agent-Development-prompt.md

**Objective:**
Develop the Processing Agent component responsible for transforming and enriching document chunks through a configurable pipeline of processing stages in the Protocol-Based Architecture.

**Context:**

* **Project Phase:** `1.0`
* **Module Focus:** `Protocol-Based Architecture - Processing Agent`
* **Task Tracking Location:** `docs/tracking/phase-1.0-protocol-based-architecture/agent-definitions/processing-agent/CHECKLISTS.md`
* **Git Branch:** `1.0-protocol-architecture` (or adapt based on project conventions)

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify Next Task:**
   a. Review the Processing Agent checklist
   b. Identify the first uncompleted task in the highest priority section (P0)
   c. Log the task details including its description and source location

2. **Design & Planning:**
   a. Design the processing pipeline architecture
   b. Define the stage interface and contract
   c. Plan the data transformation flow between stages
   d. Design error handling and recovery mechanisms
   e. Plan monitoring and observability

3. **Implementation:**
   a. Implement the core pipeline infrastructure
   b. Create base stage classes and interfaces
   c. Develop built-in processing stages (text normalization, entity extraction, etc.)
   d. Implement error handling and retry logic
   e. Add metrics collection and monitoring

4. **Integration:**
   a. Connect to MCP for model-based processing
   b. Integrate with A2A for inter-agent communication
   c. Implement event publishing for pipeline status
   d. Add health check endpoints

5. **Testing:**
   a. Unit tests for individual stages
   b. Integration tests for the full pipeline
   c. Performance testing with various workloads
   d. Error scenario testing
   e. Recovery testing

6. **Documentation:**
   a. Document the processing pipeline API
   b. Create guides for creating custom stages
   c. Document configuration options
   d. Add code comments and JSDoc

**Key Requirements:**

* **Modularity:** Easy to add/remove processing stages
* **Reliability:** Handle processing failures gracefully
* **Performance:** Efficient processing of document chunks
* **Observability:** Detailed metrics and logging
* **Extensibility:** Support for custom processing stages

**Technical Stack:**

* Language: TypeScript/Node.js
* Dependencies:
  * MCP client library
  * A2A communication library
  * Text processing utilities
  * Metrics collection libraries

**Error Handling:**

* Stage-level error boundaries
* Dead letter queue for failed chunks
* Automatic retry for transient failures
* Detailed error reporting

**Performance Considerations:**

* Parallel stage execution where possible
* Efficient memory management
* Batch processing for better throughput
* Resource usage monitoring

**Monitoring & Observability:**

* Stage execution metrics
* Error rates and types
* Processing time histograms
* Resource utilization metrics
