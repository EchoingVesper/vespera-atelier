   - Consolidation of related rule content ✅
   - Implementation of XML tag grouping ✅

### ✅ Final Implementation Tasks

5. **Documentation Updates** ✅
   - Add implementation status notation guide to rules ✅
   - Create rule activation reference documentation ✅
   - Update main README with rule optimization strategy ✅
   - Document best practices for future rule additions ✅

6. **Testing and Validation** ✅
   - Verify rule loading with different file types ✅
   - Test context size with various rule combinations ✅
   - Validate glob pattern effectiveness ✅
   - Ensure critical rules are always available ✅

## Implementation Strategy

### Tier 1: Always On (Core Architecture)

These fundamental rules will always be available to guide Claude's understanding of the A2A messaging architecture:

```yaml
---
trigger: always_on
---
```

- `code/component-relationships.md` - Critical component interaction map
- `index.md` - High-level project overview and navigation

### Tier 2: Glob Pattern (File-Type Specific)

These rules will be loaded only when working with relevant file types:

```yaml
---
trigger: glob
globs: *.{ts,js}
---
```

- `code/type-safety.md` - Interface definitions and type guards
- `code/examples.md` - Code examples for messaging patterns
- `code/organization.md` - Directory structure and file organization
- `code/performance.md` - Performance considerations for messaging

### Tier 3: Model Decision (Tool-Specific)

These specialized guides will be loaded based on relevance to the current task:

```yaml
---
trigger: model_decision
description: "Apply when working with [specific tool] functionality"
---
```

- MCP tool guides with specific descriptions for each tool

## Completed Implementation

1. ✅ Implemented tiered activation strategy for all rules
   - Tier 1: Always-on rules for critical architecture information
   - Tier 2: Glob-pattern rules for file-type specific content
   - Tier 3: Model-decision rules for specialized tool guides

2. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
   - Rule activation guide with detailed examples
   - Best practices for rule creation and maintenance
   - Implementation status notation for tracking progress

3. ✅ Optimized context usage
   - Minimized always-on rules to conserve context space
   - Implemented specific glob patterns for targeted rule loading
   - Added clear descriptions for model-decision rules

4. ✅ Validated implementation
   - Tested rule loading with different file types
   - Verified glob pattern effectiveness
   - Ensured critical rules are always available

## Implementation Status Key

The notation [4/4] indicates this task is now fully implemented:

- [0/4]: Not Started
- [1/4]: Initial Implementation
- [2/4]: Partial Implementation
- [3/4]: Near Completion
- [4/4]: Fully Implemented

## Benefits of the Optimized Rule Structure

1. **Improved Context Efficiency**
   - Only relevant rules are loaded based on file types and task context
   - Critical architecture information is always available
   - Specialized tools are loaded only when needed

2. **Enhanced Claude Performance**
   - Reduced context size allows for more efficient processing
   - Clear descriptions help Claude determine when to apply specialized rules
   - Consistent formatting improves rule comprehension

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Clear documentation of rule activation modes
   - Standardized best practices for rule creation
   - Implementation status notation for tracking progress

4. **Future-Proof Architecture**
   - Scalable approach for adding new rules
   - Organized structure for different rule categories
   - Regular review and maintenance guidelines
