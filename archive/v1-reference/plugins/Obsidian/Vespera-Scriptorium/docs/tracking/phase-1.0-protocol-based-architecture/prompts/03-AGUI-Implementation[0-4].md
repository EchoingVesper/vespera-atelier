# Phase-1.0-Protocol-Based-Architecture-AGUI-Implementation-Development-prompt.md

**Objective:**
Develop the Agent GUI (AG-UI) component for visualizing and interacting with the Protocol-Based Architecture, providing real-time monitoring and control of agents and workflows.

**Context:**
* **Project Phase:** `1.0`
* **Module Focus:** `Protocol-Based Architecture - AG-UI Implementation`
* **Task Tracking Location:** `docs/tracking/phase-1.0-protocol-based-architecture/protocol-integration/agui-implementation/CHECKLISTS.md`
* **Git Branch:** `1.0-protocol-architecture` (or adapt based on project conventions)

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify Next Task:**
   a. Review the AG-UI Implementation checklist
   b. Identify the first uncompleted task in the highest priority section (P1)
   c. Log the task details including its description and source location

2. **Design & Planning:**
   a. Design the UI/UX for agent monitoring and control
   b. Plan the real-time data flow architecture
   c. Define the component hierarchy and state management
   d. Design the WebSocket communication protocol
   e. Create mockups for key screens

3. **Implementation:**
   a. Set up the WebSocket server for real-time updates
   b. Implement core UI components (dashboards, agent cards, workflow visualizer)
   c. Develop state management for the frontend
   d. Create visualization components for agent metrics and status
   e. Implement user interaction controls

4. **Integration:**
   a. Connect to MCP server for model interactions
   b. Integrate with A2A layer for agent communication
   c. Implement real-time event streaming
   d. Add authentication and authorization

5. **Testing:**
   a. Unit tests for components and utilities
   b. Integration tests for data flow
   c. Performance testing for real-time updates
   d. Cross-browser compatibility testing

6. **Documentation:**
   a. Document component APIs
   b. Create user guides
   c. Document WebSocket protocol
   d. Add inline code documentation

**Key Requirements:**
* **Real-time Updates:** Support for live data streaming
* **Responsive Design:** Work on desktop and tablet
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliance
* **Performance:** Smooth UI with 60fps rendering
* **Security:** Secure WebSocket connections

**Technical Stack:**
* Frontend: React/TypeScript
* State Management: Redux/Recoil
* Real-time: WebSocket
* Styling: CSS-in-JS or Tailwind CSS
* Testing: Jest, React Testing Library

**Error Handling:**
* Graceful handling of connection drops
* Clear error messages for users
* Automatic reconnection logic
* Error boundaries for UI components

**Performance Considerations:**
* Virtualized lists for large datasets
* Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
* Code splitting and lazy loading
* Bundle size optimization
