# Obsidian Backend Integration Meta-PRP - Main Coordination

**Meta-PRP ID**: `OBSIDIAN_BACKEND_INTEGRATION_META_PRP_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Research and Planning Coordination  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for Multi-Model AI System  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 3-4 weeks research + 6-8 weeks implementation  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Session**: `session_6375af58_1755338579`  
**Parent Task ID**: `{task_id}`

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

**Core ED Principles for This Meta-PRP**:

- **Momentum Preservation**: Research phases with clear deliverables maintain progress across long development cycles
- **Lid Weight Reduction**: Pre-structured research templates eliminate analysis paralysis in complex integration
- **Pressure Delegation**: Specialized research agents handle different architectural domains independently
- **Damage Prevention**: Research-only phase prevents premature implementation decisions and technical debt

**Project-Specific ED Considerations**:
Blocked until CI fixes complete - prevents overwhelming context switching between infrastructure and architecture work. Multi-model AI orchestration research requires sustained focus periods.

## Executive Summary

This meta-PRP coordinates comprehensive research and planning for modernizing the Obsidian Vespera-Scriptorium plugin and integrating it with the mature vespera-scriptorium backend. The goal is to create a hierarchical multi-model AI orchestration system that serves as both a standalone MCP server and an integrated plugin+backend solution.

The systematic research approach will transform the legacy Obsidian plugin into a modern frontend for hierarchical AI orchestration that intelligently routes tasks between local LLMs (8GB VRAM constraint), medium models for standard processing, and large models for complex reasoning. Success means a comprehensive implementation roadmap with Discord log processing capability to extract and organize story/setting information into structured knowledge bases.

## Priority Structure

### Priority 1: Current State Analysis (Week 1)
**Location**: [01-current-state-analysis/](../01-current-state-analysis/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `plugin-analysis`, `backend-analysis`, `gap-analysis`  
**Issue**: Need comprehensive understanding of existing plugin and backend architecture before integration  
**Deliverables**: Current architecture documentation, integration point analysis, modernization requirements

### Priority 2: Integration Architecture Design (Week 2)
**Location**: [02-integration-architecture/](../02-integration-architecture/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `multi-model-orchestration`, `plugin-backend-integration`, `security-performance`  
**Issue**: Design unified system architecture for hierarchical AI orchestration with security and performance considerations  
**Deliverables**: Multi-model orchestration design, integration specifications, security framework

### Priority 3: Implementation Planning (Week 3)
**Location**: [03-implementation-planning/](../03-implementation-planning/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `modernization-roadmap`, `discord-processing-plan`, `deployment-strategy`  
**Issue**: Create detailed implementation roadmap with resource allocation and migration strategy  
**Deliverables**: Implementation roadmap, Discord processing pipeline plan, deployment strategy

## Multi-Agent Coordination Structure

**Orchestrator Role**: Primary coordination hub for all specialist agents

**Agent Hierarchy**:
1. **Main Coordinator** (This agent): Orchestrates entire meta-PRP
2. **Priority Specialists**: One per priority area with domain expertise
3. **Implementation Agents**: Task-specific execution agents spawned as needed

**Coordination Workflow**:
1. Initialize orchestrator session from this directory
2. Create parent task for meta-PRP coordination
3. Break down into priority-specific subtasks
4. Spawn specialist agents for each priority area
5. Monitor progress and synthesize results
6. Complete meta-PRP with comprehensive artifacts

**Git Worktree Strategy**: Yes, using isolation for parallel research work across different domains
