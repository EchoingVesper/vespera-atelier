# Research Phase: Hanging Tests Analysis

This phase contains individual research tasks for each hanging test.

## Subtasks (6 research agents)

Each research agent analyzes one specific hanging test to:
- Identify root cause of hanging behavior
- Research proper configuration and solutions
- Document implementation approach
- Prepare detailed analysis for implementation agent

## Execution Pattern

1. **Individual Analysis**: Each agent takes one hanging test
2. **Deep Investigation**: Thorough analysis of hanging cause
3. **Solution Research**: Research best practices and solutions
4. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed plan for implementation agent

## Expected Deliverables

- Root cause analysis for each hanging test
- Solution approaches with implementation guidance
- Environment and configuration requirements
- All findings stored in orchestrator artifacts
