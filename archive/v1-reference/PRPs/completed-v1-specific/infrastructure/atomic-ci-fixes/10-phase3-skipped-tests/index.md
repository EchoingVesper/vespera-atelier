# Priority 10: Phase 3 Skipped Tests Analysis

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: [TODO]  
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Specialist Type**: devops + tester  
**Local LLM Ready**: ‚úÖ High (with research phase)
**Test Category**: Skipped Tests (4 tests)

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: 4 GitHub Actions tests are being skipped, potentially indicating missing test coverage or configuration issues.

**Impact**: Skipped tests may represent gaps in validation coverage or tests that should be running but are improperly configured.

**Analysis Required**: Determine if skipping is intentional and appropriate, or if these tests should be running.

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: 4 individual skipped tests analyzed separately  
**Momentum Preservation**: Each test gets dedicated research + implementation agent pair  
**Pressure Delegation**: Distributed across 8 agents (4 research + 4 implementation)
**Damage Prevention**: Ensure appropriate test coverage without unnecessary test execution

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Research Analysis (4 agents)
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Agents**: 4 research specialists
- **Deliverables**: Skip reason analysis and coverage assessment for each test
- **Tools**: Workflow configuration analysis, test coverage review

### Phase 1: Implementation Fixes (4 agents)  
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Agents**: 4 implementation specialists
- **Dependencies**: Corresponding research phase completion
- **Deliverables**: Appropriate test configuration (enable or properly exclude)

## Test Categories (Skipped - 4 tests)

### Expected Skip Types
- **Conditional Skips**: Tests properly skipped based on conditions
- **Environment Skips**: Tests skipped due to environment constraints  
- **Feature Skips**: Tests skipped because features are disabled/unavailable
- **Configuration Skips**: Tests improperly skipped due to configuration issues

## Analysis Focus Areas

**For Each Skipped Test:**
1. **Skip Reason**: Why is the test being skipped?
2. **Skip Condition**: What condition triggers the skip?
3. **Test Purpose**: What does this test validate?
4. **Coverage Impact**: Does skipping create a coverage gap?
5. **Environment Requirements**: What does the test need to run?
6. **Intentionality**: Is this skip intentional and appropriate?

## Research Methodology

**Each Research Agent Will:**
1. **Skip Configuration Analysis**: Review workflow conditions causing skip
2. **Test Purpose Review**: Understand what the test is meant to validate
3. **Coverage Assessment**: Evaluate if skip creates validation gaps
4. **Environment Review**: Check if test requirements are available
5. **Best Practice Research**: Research proper test skipping patterns
6. **Recommendation**: Determine if test should run or remain skipped

## Implementation Strategy

**Each Implementation Agent Will:**
1. **Enable Appropriate Tests**: Configure skipped tests that should run
2. **Fix Skip Conditions**: Correct improper skip conditions
3. **Improve Skip Handling**: Add clear documentation for intentional skips
4. **Environment Setup**: Provide necessary environment for tests to run
5. **Conditional Logic**: Implement proper conditional execution
6. **Documentation**: Document skip reasons for transparency

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Priority Task**:
```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3 Skipped Tests Analysis and Configuration" \
  description="Analysis and proper configuration for 4 skipped GitHub Actions tests" \
  complexity="simple" \
  task_type="breakdown" \
  specialist_type="coordinator" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern

**Workflow**: Research ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

1. **Research Agents (4)**:
   - Each analyzes one specific skipped test
   - Investigate skip conditions and test purpose
   - Assess whether skip is appropriate or problematic
   - Research proper test configuration approaches

2. **Implementation Agents (4)**:
   - Receive skip analysis from corresponding research agent
   - Implement appropriate configuration changes
   - Either enable test execution or improve skip handling
   - Document configuration decisions

## Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All 4 skipped tests analyzed for skip appropriateness
- [ ] Determination made: appropriate skip vs should-run test
- [ ] Configuration updated for tests that should run
- [ ] Clear documentation for tests that should remain skipped
- [ ] Test coverage gaps eliminated or properly documented

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] No inappropriate test skipping
- [ ] Clear documentation for all skip decisions
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] Workflow transparency enhanced

## Expected Outcomes

**Possible Resolutions per Test:**
- **Enable Test**: Skip condition removed, test now runs appropriately
- **Fix Skip Condition**: Skip condition corrected to work properly
- **Document Skip**: Skip is appropriate and now properly documented
- **Conditional Execution**: Test configured to run only when conditions are met
- **Environment Provision**: Environment provided so test can run

## Validation Protocol

**After Implementation:**
1. **Skip Logic Test**: Verify skip conditions work as intended
2. **Execution Test**: Confirm enabled tests run successfully
3. **Coverage Review**: Validate test coverage is appropriate
4. **Documentation Review**: Check skip reasons are clear
5. **Integration Test**: Ensure changes don't affect other tests

## Documentation Requirements

**For Each Test:**
- **Skip Reason**: Clear explanation of why test is skipped
- **Conditions**: Specific conditions that trigger skip
- **Coverage Note**: Impact on overall test coverage
- **Alternative Validation**: How validation is achieved if test is skipped
