# Priority 1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Specialist Type**: devops  
**Local LLM Ready**: ✅ High

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: CI/CD infrastructure failures preventing reliable builds and deployments due to missing branch protection and unreliable maintenance workflows

**Impact**: Without reliable CI/CD, development velocity decreases, code quality suffers, and deployment confidence erodes. Direct pushes to main bypass review processes.

**Context**: Comprehensive code review identified specific infrastructure gaps including missing branch protection rules and maintenance workflow failures requiring debug enhancement

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: Pre-structured JSON configs and CLI commands eliminate decision paralysis around security setup

**Momentum Preservation**: Atomic tasks with clear input/output specs maintain progress across sessions  

**Pressure Delegation**: Each task delegated to specialist agents with minimal context requirements (<800 tokens)

**Damage Prevention**: All changes are reversible with clear rollback procedures and validation gates

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Branch protection rules block direct pushes to main branch
- PR reviews required with status checks enforced
- Maintenance workflow completes successfully with clear error reporting

### Technical Requirements

- GitHub CLI commands for automated setup
- Debug logging integrated into existing workflow YAML
- Error recovery with progressive backoff (3 attempts: 10s, 30s, 60s delays)

### Quality Requirements

- JSON configuration validates successfully
- YAML syntax remains valid after modifications
- Commands executable without manual intervention

## Subtasks Overview

### Task Categories

**00-branch-protection**: Branch Protection Configuration

- Purpose: Set up automated branch protection rules for main branch
- LLM Ready: ✅
- Tasks: 2 atomic tasks

**01-maintenance-workflow**: Maintenance Workflow Enhancement  

- Purpose: Add debug logging and error recovery to failing maintenance workflow
- LLM Ready: ✅
- Tasks: 2 atomic tasks

### Detailed Subtasks

#### **Category 1: Branch Protection**

- [01-generate-branch-protection-config.md](subtasks/00-branch-protection/01-generate-branch-protection-config.md) - Generate JSON configuration for branch protection rules
- [02-generate-github-cli-command.md](subtasks/00-branch-protection/02-generate-github-cli-command.md) - Convert JSON config to executable gh CLI command

#### **Category 2: Maintenance Workflow**

- [01-add-debug-logging.md](subtasks/01-maintenance-workflow/01-add-debug-logging.md) - Add comprehensive debug logging to maintenance workflow
- [02-add-error-recovery.md](subtasks/01-maintenance-workflow/02-add-error-recovery.md) - Implement error recovery with retry logic

## Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**:

- [ ] Branch protection rules successfully configured and enforced
- [ ] Maintenance workflow passes with debug logging active
- [ ] Error recovery tested with simulated failures
- [ ] All subtasks completed successfully
- [ ] Quality validation passes
- [ ] Integration testing successful

**Quality Gates**:

- [ ] Branch protection blocks direct pushes to main
- [ ] JSON configuration validates without errors
- [ ] YAML workflow syntax remains valid

**Deliverables**:

- Working branch protection configuration
- Enhanced maintenance workflow with debug logging
- Error recovery mechanisms with progressive backoff
- Orchestrator artifacts with detailed implementation work

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Priority Task**:

```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Critical Infrastructure Fixes" \
  description="Configure branch protection and enhance maintenance workflow with debug logging and error recovery" \
  complexity="moderate" \
  task_type="implementation" \
  specialist_type="devops" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

**Spawn Specialist Agent**:

```bash
# Use Task tool to spawn specialist with context:
# "You are a DEVOPS SPECIALIST executing orchestrator task: {task_id}
#  Working on: Critical Infrastructure Fixes
#  Context: Configure branch protection and enhance CI/CD reliability
#  Use orchestrator_execute_task to get detailed instructions
#  Complete with orchestrator_complete_task storing all detailed work"
```

**Monitor Progress**:

```bash
orchestrator_query_tasks parent_task_id="{this_priority_task_id}"
```

## Agent Coordination

**Primary Specialist**: DevOps (CI/CD configuration and workflow enhancement)

**Supporting Specialists**: None required (atomic tasks are self-contained)

**Coordination Pattern**:
Sequential - Each atomic task builds on the previous with clear handoffs

**Dependencies**:

- Requires completion of: None (first priority)
- Provides input to: Priority 2 (Configuration Fixes)
- Parallel work with: None (critical path)

## Git Worktree Strategy

**Isolation Needed**: No - Sequential atomic tasks with safe, reversible changes

**Branch Strategy**:

```bash
# If using worktree isolation:
git worktree add ../worktrees/agent-{priority-slug} -b feature/{priority-slug}

# Agent works in: ../worktrees/agent-{priority-slug}
# Auto-preserve: git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: $(date)"
# Complete: git add -A && git commit -m "feat({scope}): {description}"
```

## Local LLM Integration

**Automation Potential**: High

**LLM-Ready Tasks**: 4 of 4 tasks ready for local LLM execution

**Prompt Templates**: Available in each high-readiness subtask file

**Validation Approach**: JSON validation, YAML syntax checking, and CLI command testing

## Tracking

**Progress Checklist**: [tracking/checklist.md](tracking/checklist.md)  
**Session Logs**: [tracking/session-logs/](tracking/session-logs/)  
**Artifacts**: Referenced in orchestrator task completion

**Status Updates**: Update this section as work progresses
