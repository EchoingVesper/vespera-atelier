# Test Requirements Summary for vespera-file-ops Library

## Overview

This document summarizes all test requirements derived from the comprehensive Gherkin behavioral specifications for the rust-file-ops library. The library is designed as a **library** (not an application) with clean API, structured error handling, and comprehensive Unicode support.

## Architecture Requirements

### Library Design Constraints
- **Target**: Rust library with multiple output formats (lib, cdylib, staticlib)
- **Error Handling**: Use `thiserror` for structured, programmatic error types
- **API**: Clean, minimal public API in `src/lib.rs`
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies for core functionality
- **Unicode**: UTF-8 native with proper character boundary handling

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Idempotency**: Operations should be idempotent where appropriate
2. **Atomicity**: Multi-edit operations should be atomic (all succeed or all fail)
3. **Performance**: Reasonable performance on large files (up to 100MB)
4. **Memory Safety**: Bounded memory usage, no leaks
5. **Thread Safety**: Clear thread safety guarantees

## Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Basic String Replacement Operations (`edit_operations.feature`)

#### Essential Features
- **Single occurrence replacement**: Replace first match only
- **All occurrences replacement**: Replace all matches with `replace_all` flag
- **Exact whitespace preservation**: Preserve tabs, spaces, indentation exactly
- **Case-sensitive matching**: Only exact case matches by default
- **Pattern not found handling**: Return 0 replacements, no error
- **Empty string replacement**: Support deletion via empty replacement
- **Idempotency**: Same operation applied twice produces same result

#### Critical Test Cases
- Pattern spans multiple lines with line ending preservation
- Pattern at file boundaries (beginning, end, entire file)
- Replacement significantly changes file size
- Pattern contains special characters (treated literally, not as regex)
- Very long patterns (up to MAX_PATTERN_SIZE)
- Overlapping pattern candidates (first match only)

#### Performance Requirements
- Handle files up to 100MB reasonably (< 30 seconds)
- Memory usage should not exceed 2x file size
- Efficient string matching (avoid regex for predictable performance)

### 2. Multi-Edit Operations (`multi_edit.feature`)

#### Sequential Processing Model
- **Order dependence**: Edits applied sequentially, each operates on result of previous
- **Partial failure handling**: Some edits can fail while others succeed
- **Chaining support**: Edit results can create patterns for subsequent edits
- **Atomic failure option**: All edits fail if any operation is invalid

#### Critical Test Cases
- **Edit affects subsequent edits**: Pattern replacement creates/removes future targets
- **Mixed replace_all flags**: Some edits replace all, others replace first only
- **Large edit sequences**: 100+ sequential edits with bounded memory
- **Empty operations list**: Should succeed with no changes
- **Undo-like sequences**: Reversible operation pairs

#### Result Tracking Requirements
- Track total replacements across all edits
- Record which edits succeeded vs failed
- Provide detailed error context for failed operations

### 3. Unicode Handling (`unicode_handling.feature`)

#### Unicode Support Requirements
- **UTF-8 native**: All operations use char indices, not byte indices
- **Character boundary respect**: Never split multi-byte sequences
- **Normalization**: Use NFC (canonical composed) form consistently
- **Script mixing**: Handle transitions between different scripts correctly

#### Critical Unicode Scenarios
- **Multi-byte characters**: Chinese, Arabic, emoji, mathematical symbols
- **Combining characters**: Diacritical marks handled atomically
- **Surrogate pairs**: Mathematical bold, complex symbols
- **Bidirectional text**: RTL/LTR mixing preserved
- **Control characters**: Tab, newline, zero-width characters
- **Grapheme clusters**: Complex emoji sequences (family, flags)

#### Normalization Requirements
- **Equivalence handling**: Both composed (é) and decomposed (e + ◌́) forms
- **Consistent output**: Results always in NFC form
- **Performance**: Unicode processing should not cause significant overhead

### 4. Error Handling (`error_scenarios.feature`)

#### Structured Error Types (using `thiserror`)
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum EditError {
    #[error("Pattern cannot be empty")]
    EmptyPattern,
    
    #[error("Pattern too large: {size} bytes, maximum is {max}")]
    PatternTooLarge { size: usize, max: usize },
    
    #[error("File too large: {size} bytes, maximum is {max}")]
    FileTooLarge { size: u64, max: u64 },
    
    #[error("Invalid UTF-8 at position {position}")]
    InvalidUtf8 { position: usize },
    
    #[error("File not found: {path}")]
    FileNotFound { path: String },
    
    #[error("Permission denied: {operation} access to {path}")]
    PermissionDenied { operation: String, path: String },
    
    // ... additional error types
}
```

#### Error Handling Requirements
- **Programmatic access**: Structured fields for error handling logic
- **Clear messages**: Human-readable descriptions for debugging
- **Context preservation**: Include relevant operation parameters
- **No partial state**: Failed operations should not corrupt files
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup on error conditions

#### Critical Error Scenarios
- File system errors (permissions, space, locks)
- Encoding errors (invalid UTF-8, normalization failures)
- Resource limits (memory, file size, pattern size)
- Concurrent modification detection
- System interruption handling

### 5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions (`edge_cases.feature`)

#### File Content Edge Cases
- **Empty files**: 0-byte files should be handled gracefully
- **Single character files**: Minimal content replacement
- **Only whitespace**: Spaces, tabs, newlines only
- **Very large files**: Up to 500MB with bounded memory usage
- **Mixed line endings**: Preserve CRLF, LF, CR combinations exactly

#### Pattern Matching Edge Cases
- **Consecutive patterns**: "aaaa" with pattern "aa"
- **Overlapping candidates**: Non-greedy first-match behavior
- **Pattern at boundaries**: Beginning/end of file, buffer boundaries
- **Unicode at boundaries**: Multi-byte characters spanning buffers
- **Zero-length considerations**: Prevent infinite loops

#### Performance Edge Cases
- **Many small patterns**: 100,000 single character replacements
- **Very long lines**: Single line with 1,000,000 characters
- **Deep nesting**: Nested quotes, escapes, complex structures
- **Memory pressure**: Graceful degradation under resource constraints

## Implementation Requirements

### Data Structure Recommendations
Based on research findings:

1. **Text Representation**: Use Ropey for efficient large text editing
   - O(log n) insert/delete operations
   - UTF-8 native with proper char indexing
   - Good memory efficiency for large documents

2. **Pattern Matching**: Use Myers diff algorithm
   - Optimal minimal edit distance
   - Predictable O(ND) performance
   - Battle-tested in Git

3. **Memory Management**: Bounded allocation strategy
   - Streaming processing for large files
   - Incremental memory allocation
   - Proper cleanup on errors

### API Design Requirements

#### Public API Structure
```rust
// Clean public interface
pub use edit::{EditOperation, EditResult, MultiEditResult};
pub use error::{EditError, Result};

// Core functions
pub fn edit_text(content: &str, pattern: &str, replacement: &str, replace_all: bool) -> Result<EditResult>;
pub fn multi_edit_text(content: &str, operations: Vec<EditOperation>) -> Result<MultiEditResult>;
pub fn edit_file(path: &Path, pattern: &str, replacement: &str, replace_all: bool) -> Result<EditResult>;
pub fn multi_edit_file(path: &Path, operations: Vec<EditOperation>) -> Result<MultiEditResult>;
```

#### Result Types
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct EditResult {
    pub content: String,
    pub replacements: usize,
    pub operations_applied: Vec<EditOperation>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct MultiEditResult {
    pub content: String,
    pub total_replacements: usize,
    pub successful_operations: usize,
    pub failed_operations: Vec<(EditOperation, EditError)>,
}
```

## Testing Strategy Requirements

### 1. Unit Tests
