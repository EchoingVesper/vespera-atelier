# Agent A: String Matching Research

## Objective
Research and document best practices for implementing precise string matching in text editors, focusing on algorithms that preserve whitespace and handle edge cases.

## Research Topics

### 1. Diff Algorithms
- [ ] Myers diff algorithm implementation details
- [ ] Hunt-McIlroy algorithm comparison
- [ ] Patience diff algorithm benefits
- [ ] When to use each algorithm

### 2. Text Editor Implementations
- [ ] VS Code's edit implementation (Microsoft/vscode repo)
- [ ] How VS Code handles whitespace preservation
- [ ] Monaco editor's approach
- [ ] TextMate's string replacement strategy

### 3. Rope Data Structures
- [ ] xi-rope implementation in xi-editor
- [ ] Ropey crate for Rust
- [ ] Performance characteristics
- [ ] When ropes are beneficial vs simple strings

### 4. Edge Cases to Handle
- [ ] Unicode normalization issues
- [ ] Mixed line endings (CRLF vs LF)
- [ ] Tab vs space preservation
- [ ] Multi-byte character boundaries
- [ ] Zero-width characters

## Resources to Investigate
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode (search for edit/replace implementation)
- https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor (rope implementation)
- https://github.com/cessen/ropey (Rust rope library)
- https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/ (diff algorithm explanations)
- https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

## Deliverables
1. `research_string_matching.md` - Comprehensive findings
2. `recommended_algorithm.md` - Recommended approach for our use case
3. Code snippets showing key implementation patterns

## Success Criteria
- Identify the most suitable string matching algorithm
- Document how to preserve whitespace exactly
- Provide concrete implementation examples
- List all edge cases with solutions
