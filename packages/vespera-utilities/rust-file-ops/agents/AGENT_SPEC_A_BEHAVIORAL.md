# Agent SPEC-A: Behavioral Specifications

## Objective
Write comprehensive Gherkin-style behavioral specifications for the editing operations BEFORE implementation begins.

## Specifications to Create

### 1. Basic String Replacement
```gherkin
Feature: Precise String Editing
  As a developer
  I want to replace exact strings in files
  So that I can make precise code modifications

  Scenario: Single occurrence replacement
    Given a file "test.rs" with content:
      """
      fn main() {
          let foo = "bar";
          println!("{}", foo);
      }
      """
    When I replace "foo" with "baz" (first occurrence only)
    Then the file contains:
      """
      fn main() {
          let baz = "bar";
          println!("{}", foo);
      }
      """

  Scenario: All occurrences replacement
    Given a file with "const foo = foo + foo"
    When I replace all "foo" with "bar"
    Then the file contains "const bar = bar + bar"

  Scenario: Preserve exact whitespace
    Given a file with "  const  foo  =  bar  "
    When I replace "foo" with "baz"
    Then the file contains "  const  baz  =  bar  "
    And whitespace is preserved exactly

  Scenario: String not found
    Given a file with "const bar = 123"
    When I try to replace "foo" with "baz"
    Then an error "StringNotFound" is returned
    And the file remains unchanged
```

### 2. Multi-Edit Operations
```gherkin
Feature: Sequential Multi-Edit
  Scenario: Multiple edits in sequence
    Given a file with:
      """
      const foo = 1;
      const bar = 2;
      const baz = 3;
      """
    When I apply edits in sequence:
      | old_string | new_string | replace_all |
      | foo       | xxx        | false       |
      | bar       | yyy        | false       |
      | baz       | zzz        | false       |
    Then the file contains:
      """
      const xxx = 1;
      const yyy = 2;
      const zzz = 3;
      """

  Scenario: Edit affects subsequent edits
    Given a file with "foo bar baz"
    When I apply edits:
      | old_string | new_string | replace_all |
      | foo bar    | bar foo    | false       |
      | bar foo    | result     | false       |
    Then the file contains "result baz"
```

### 3. Unicode and Special Characters
```gherkin
Feature: Unicode Support
  Scenario: Edit with emoji
    Given a file with "Hello üëã World"
    When I replace "üëã" with "üåç"
    Then the file contains "Hello üåç World"

  Scenario: Multi-byte character boundaries
    Given a file with "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
    When I replace "Â•Ω" with "Âó®"
    Then the file contains "‰Ω†Âó®‰∏ñÁïå"

  Scenario: Zero-width characters
    Given a file with "test\u200Bword" (zero-width space)
    When I replace "test\u200Bword" with "combined"
    Then the file contains "combined"
```

### 4. Line Ending Preservation
```gherkin
Feature: Line Ending Handling
  Scenario: Preserve CRLF
    Given a file with CRLF line endings
    When I edit any content
    Then CRLF line endings are preserved

  Scenario: Preserve LF
    Given a file with LF line endings
    When I edit any content
    Then LF line endings are preserved

  Scenario: Mixed line endings warning
    Given a file with mixed line endings
    When I edit content
    Then a warning is issued
    And existing line endings are preserved
```

### 5. Error Handling
```gherkin
Feature: Error Scenarios
  Scenario: Multiple matches without replace_all
    Given a file with "foo bar foo"
    When I try to replace "foo" with "baz" (single occurrence)
    And multiple matches exist
    Then an error "MultipleMatches" is returned
    With locations of all matches

  Scenario: Invalid UTF-8 sequences
    Given a file with invalid UTF-8
    When I try to edit it
    Then an error "EncodingError" is returned
    With details about the invalid sequence

  Scenario: File too large
    Given a file larger than MAX_FILE_SIZE
    When I try to edit it
    Then an error "FileTooLarge" is returned
    With the actual size and limit
```

## Deliverables
1. `specs/edit_operations.feature` - Complete Gherkin specs
2. `specs/multi_edit.feature` - Multi-edit scenarios
3. `specs/unicode_handling.feature` - Unicode edge cases
4. `specs/error_scenarios.feature` - Error handling specs
5. `test_requirements.md` - Summary of all test requirements

## Success Criteria
- Cover all normal use cases
- Define all edge cases
- Specify exact error behaviors
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for implementation
