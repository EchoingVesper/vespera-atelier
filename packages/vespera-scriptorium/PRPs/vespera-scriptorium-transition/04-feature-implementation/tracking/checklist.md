## Executive Dysfunction Considerations

Feature implementation is broken down to prevent overwhelm:
- **Phase-based approach** allows for breaks between major milestones
- **Individual feature tracking** provides granular progress visibility
- **Clear success criteria** eliminate ambiguity about completion
- [ ] **Integration testing** ensures features work together without conflicts

## Notes

This represents the transformation from "MCP Task Orchestrator" to "Vespera Scriptorium" - a comprehensive platform for managing ideas, documents, and creative workflows beyond just code.
