# Hook Design Subtasks

**Purpose**: Design agent-spawning hooks for templates  
**Local LLM Ready**: Architecture design tasks with clear specifications  
**Executive Dysfunction Support**: Component-focused design with clear interfaces

## Hook Types to Design

1. **Template Creation Hooks**: Triggered when new templates are created
2. **Template Instantiation Hooks**: Triggered when templates are applied to projects  
3. **Project Initialization Hooks**: Triggered during new project setup
4. **Task Completion Hooks**: Triggered when orchestrator tasks complete

## Design Principles

- **Event-Driven**: Hooks respond to specific template events
- **Configurable**: Templates specify which agents to spawn
- **Isolated**: Each hook spawns agents in isolated contexts
- **Local LLM Ready**: Hook configurations support local model execution
