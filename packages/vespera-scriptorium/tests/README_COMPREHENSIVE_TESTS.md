# Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite implementation for Vespera Scriptorium, following Clean Architecture principles and providing full coverage across all architectural layers.

## Test Architecture

The test suite is organized into distinct layers that mirror the Clean Architecture:

### 1. Domain Layer Tests (`tests/domain/`)
- **test_entities_comprehensive.py**: Complete entity testing including business logic validation, invariant enforcement, and lifecycle transitions
- **test_value_objects_comprehensive.py**: Value object immutability, validation, and behavior testing
- **test_services_comprehensive.py**: Domain service testing with business rule validation

### 2. Application Layer Tests (`tests/application/`)
- **test_usecases_comprehensive.py**: Use case orchestration, DTO validation, and interface contracts
- **test_dtos_comprehensive.py**: Data Transfer Object validation and serialization testing

### 3. Infrastructure Layer Tests (`tests/infrastructure/`)
- **test_repositories_comprehensive.py**: Repository implementations, database operations, and data persistence
- **test_mcp_tools_comprehensive.py**: MCP protocol compliance and tool integration testing

### 4. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **test_complete_workflows_comprehensive.py**: End-to-end workflow testing and system behavior validation

### 5. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)
