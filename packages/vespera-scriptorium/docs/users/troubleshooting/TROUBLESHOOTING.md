# MCP Task Orchestrator - Troubleshooting Guide

*Quick solutions to common issues*

#

# 🔍 Quick Diagnosis

**Start here**: Try these in order before diving into specific errors:

1. **Restart your MCP client completely** (fixes 70% of issues)

2. **Check the basics**: Python 3.8+, Node.js 16+, supported MCP client installed

3. **Run diagnostics**: `python scripts/diagnostics/verify_tools.py`

#

# 🚨 Common Error Messages

#

#

# "Could not connect to MCP server" / "Claude was unable to connect"

**Most Common Cause**: Client needs restart after configuration changes

**Solutions**:

1. **Restart your MCP client completely** (not just reload)

2. Verify configuration file exists and has correct syntax:

- **Claude Desktop**: Check `claude_desktop_config.json` file

- **Cursor**: Check `.cursor/mcp.json` file  

3. Use absolute paths (not relative) in configuration

4. Check logs for specific error details

#

#

# ImportError: "attempted relative import with no known parent package"

**Cause**: Using deprecated installation method

**Solution**:

1. Use the optimized installer: `python run_installer.py`

2. For legacy compatibility: `python install.py` (redirects to optimized method)

3. See [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for complete transition guidance

# Installation Method Issues ⚠️ RESOLVED

**Previous Issue**: "'SpecialistManager' object has no attribute 'project_dir'"

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - This error has been fixed in the current version

**Solution**: Use the recommended installation method:

```bash
python run_installer.py

```text

If you encounter this error, you may be using an outdated installation method or have cached files. Try:

1. Use `python run_installer.py` instead of deprecated methods

2. Restart your MCP client completely

3. If persistent, delete and recreate: `rm -rf venv_mcp && python run_installer.py`

#

#

# "'StateManager' object has no attribute '_get_parent_task_id'"

**Cause**: Missing method in StateManager class

**Status**: Known issue, does not prevent core functionality

**Workaround**: Task orchestration still works, parent task tracking may show errors

#

#

# "spawn npx ENOENT" (Windows)

**Cause**: Node.js not in PATH for GUI applications

**Solutions**:

1. Use absolute path to node in configuration:
   

```text

json
   {
     "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
     "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\mcp\\server\\index.js"]
   }
   

```text

2. Add Node.js to system PATH (not just user PATH)

3. Run Command Prompt as Administrator

#

#

# "No MCP clients detected"

**Solutions**:

1. Install a supported MCP client first

2. Run the client at least once before installing orchestrator

3. Re-run `python install.py` after client installation

#

#

# "Module not found" / Import Errors

**Solutions**:

1. Delete virtual environment and reinstall:
   

```text

bash
   rm -rf venv_mcp && python install.py
   

```text
text

2. Check Python version is 3.8+

3. Verify all dependencies installed correctly

#

# 🔧 Platform-Specific Issues

#

#

# Windows

- Use Command Prompt (not PowerShell) for installation

- Run as Administrator if permission errors occur

- Use absolute paths in all configurations

- Check Node.js is in system PATH

#

#

# macOS

- May need to allow apps to run from "System Preferences > Security"

- Use Terminal (not other shell apps) for installation

- Check Xcode command line tools installed

#

#

# Linux

- Ensure Python 3.8+ and pip are installed

- May need `python3` instead of `python` in commands

- Check file permissions on configuration directories

#

# 📋 Diagnostic Commands
