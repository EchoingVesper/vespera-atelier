# Task Orchestrator Issues Found During Directory Cleanup Testing

#

# Date: May 29, 2025

#

# Context: Testing task orchestrator functionality during directory cleanup project

#

# Issue 1: Missing StateManager Method

**Error:** `'StateManager' object has no attribute '_get_parent_task_id'`

**Occurrence:** Consistent error when completing subtasks using `orchestrator_complete_subtask`

**Impact:** 

- Subtasks complete successfully but parent task progress tracking fails

- Parent task progress shows "unknown" with error message

- Does not prevent subtask execution or completion

- May affect task dependency tracking and orchestration flow

**Frequency:** Every subtask completion during this test session

**Error Location:** StateManager class missing `_get_parent_task_id` method

**Recommended Fix:**

1. Add missing `_get_parent_task_id` method to StateManager class

2. Implement proper parent task ID lookup functionality

3. Test parent task progress tracking with the fix

#

# Issue 2: Directory Creation During Task Execution

**Observation:** During test file reorganization, the `tests/performance/` directory was missing despite being created in an earlier subtask

**Impact:** 

- Required manual recreation of directory during file moves

- Suggests possible issue with directory persistence or task state coordination

**Possible Causes:**

- Directory creation not properly persisted

- Race condition between subtasks

- Database/file system synchronization issue

#

# Testing Progress

**Successful Operations:**

- Task planning and subtask creation ✓

- Individual subtask execution and specialist role assignment ✓  

- File and directory operations through subtasks ✓

- Complex multi-step orchestration ✓

**Areas Needing Attention:**

- Parent task progress tracking (StateManager issue)

- Cross-subtask state persistence verification

- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

#

# Overall Assessment

The task orchestrator core functionality is working well for complex orchestration tasks. The StateManager issue is a minor bug that doesn't prevent successful task execution, but should be addressed for proper task tracking and dependency management.

**Test Status:** Directory cleanup orchestration proceeding successfully despite the tracking issue.

#

# Issue 3: Path Resolution Problems in Moved Scripts

**Discovery:** During post-reorganization testing, several diagnostic scripts failed due to hardcoded relative paths

**Specific Examples:**

- `scripts/diagnostics/diagnose_db.py` looking for database in wrong location

- Scripts using `Path(__file__).parent / "task_orchestrator.db"` after being moved to subdirectories

**Impact:** Medium - Diagnostic tools non-functional until fixed

**Resolution Applied:**

- Updated path logic to calculate project root: `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`

- Added fallback database location checking

- Tested fix successfully

**Lessons Learned:**

- Scripts should use project root-relative paths, not script-relative paths

- Path resolution needs testing after any directory reorganization

- Consider creating a common path utility module

#

# Issue 4: Unicode Compatibility in Console Output

**Discovery:** Advanced diagnostic tools failed on Windows due to Unicode emoji characters

**Error:** `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character`

**Impact:** Low-Medium - Diagnostic tools unusable on Windows systems

**Resolution Applied:**

- Created ASCII-compatible versions of diagnostic tools

- Used simple text indicators instead of Unicode symbols

- Maintained functionality while ensuring cross-platform compatibility

**Lessons Learned:**

- Console output should be compatible with Windows CP1252 encoding

- Provide both advanced (Unicode) and simple (ASCII) versions of tools

- Test tools on multiple platforms and encoding environments

#

# Issue 5: Database Schema Assumptions

**Discovery:** Some diagnostic scripts assumed table names that didn't match actual schema

**Example:** Looking for `tasks` table when actual table is `task_breakdowns`

**Impact:** Low - Easy to fix but shows need for schema documentation

**Resolution Applied:**

- Updated scripts to use correct table names

- Verified against actual database schema

**Lessons Learned:**

- Maintain up-to-date schema documentation

- Scripts should validate table existence before querying

- Consider creating database utility functions for common operations
