# Parallel Execution Pattern

*1700 char limit - Concurrent task coordination with synchronization*

#

# Pattern Overview

Execute independent subtasks simultaneously while maintaining coordination and synchronization points. Use when subtasks have no dependencies and can run concurrently.

#

# Implementation Steps

#

#

# Phase 1: Dependency Analysis

```text

1. orchestrator_plan_task() - Identify independent subtasks

2. Group tasks by dependencies and execution requirements

3. Define synchronization points for convergence

```text

#

#

# Phase 2: Parallel Launch

```text

4. For each independent group:

- orchestrator_execute_subtask(task_id_A)

- [Claude Code Operations A] - Concurrent execution

- orchestrator_execute_subtask(task_id_B) 

- [Claude Code Operations B] - Concurrent execution

```text

#

#

# Phase 3: Synchronization and Integration

```text

5. orchestrator_complete_subtask() for each parallel task

6. Verify all parallel tasks completed successfully

7. orchestrator_synthesize_results() - Combine outputs
```text

#

# Coordination Benefits

- **Speed**: Reduced total execution time

- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of available tools

- **Scalability**: Handles complex workflows with multiple independent paths

- **Flexibility**: Adapts to varying task complexity

#

# Best Practices

- Ensure true independence between parallel tasks

- Plan synchronization points for integration

- Handle partial failures gracefully

- Monitor resource usage and conflicts

**Use When**: Independent file operations, parallel analysis, concurrent validations
