# Enterprise Feature Release Coordination

*⭐ Featured Example: Multi-team payment system integration across 5 services*

#

# 🎯 Project Overview

**Scenario**: Implement new payment processing across Frontend, API Gateway, Payment Service, User Service, and Analytics teams
**Challenge**: Shared API contracts, database migrations, security compliance, staged rollout
**Tools**: Task Orchestrator MCP + Claude Code MCP + Team-specific toolchains

#

# 🔄 Sequential Coordination Pattern

```bash
orchestrator_plan_task({
  "description": "Deploy payment system v2 across 5 teams with zero downtime",
  "complexity_level": "very_complex",
  "subtasks_json": "[{
    \"title\": \"API Contract Definition and Validation\",
    \"specialist_type\": \"architect\"
  }, {
    \"title\": \"Parallel Development Coordination\",
    \"specialist_type\": \"implementer\"
  }]"
})

# 🔄 Multi-Team Coordination Patterns

**Orchestrator Role**: Facilitates cross-team API contract negotiation
**Claude Code Role**: API schema validation, documentation generation

```text
bash

# Contract definition and validation

read_file: api-contracts/payment-v2.openapi.yml
execute_command: swagger-codegen validate api-contracts/payment-v2.openapi.yml
write_file: team-contracts/frontend-requirements.md

# Frontend Team (React/TypeScript)

create_directory: frontend/src/payment-v2/
write_file: frontend/src/payment-v2/PaymentForm.tsx

# Backend Teams (Java/Spring)

create_directory: payment-service/src/main/java/v2/
write_file: payment-service/src/main/java/v2/PaymentController.java

# Database Migration Coordination

execute_command: liquibase --context=payment-v2 update

#

# 🏆 Success Patterns

- **Contract-First Development**: API contracts established before implementation

- **Parallel Execution**: Teams work independently with orchestrated checkpoints
