# Development Workflows

*Building apps, APIs, and tools with Task Orchestrator + Claude Code MCP*

The combination of systematic task orchestration with intelligent code execution creates development workflows that consistently deliver well-tested results.

#

# The Development Sweet Spot

**Perfect for:**

- Multi-component features (authentication, payment processing, API integrations)

- Unfamiliar technologies or frameworks  

- Projects requiring comprehensive testing and documentation

- Time-sensitive deliverables where quality can't be compromised

#

# Pattern 1: The "Full-Stack Feature" Workflow

*Building a complete user authentication system*

#

#

# Setup: Dual MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-orchestrator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-task-orchestrator/launch_orchestrator.py"]
    },
    "claude-code": {
      "command": "claude-code", 
      "args": ["--mcp", "--working-directory", "your-project-path"]
    }
  }
}

#

#

# Step 1: Initialize and Plan

```text

Initialize orchestration session for secure user authentication system 
(React/Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, GDPR compliance, rate limiting)

```text

**Task breakdown created:**

1. Security Architecture Design (architect)

2. Database Schema Implementation (implementer) 

3. Authentication API Development (implementer)

4. Frontend Integration (implementer)  

5. Security Testing (tester)

6. Documentation Creation (documenter)

#

#

# Step 2: Architecture with Orchestrator

```text

Execute the security architecture design subtask

```text

**Specialist Focus:** The architect considers:

- Password hashing strategies (bcrypt vs argon2)

- JWT token lifecycle and refresh patterns  

- Rate limiting and brute force protection

- GDPR compliance requirements

- Session management approaches

**Output:** Comprehensive security architecture document with technology recommendations, data flow diagrams, and implementation guidelines.

#

#

# Step 3: Implementation with Claude Code Integration

Now the magic happens - seamless handoff to Claude Code for implementation:

```text

Switch to Claude Code MCP and implement the database schema based on the architecture design

```text

**Claude Code Excellence:**

- Creates migration files with proper indexing

- Implements GDPR-compliant user data structure

- Adds audit logging tables

- Includes proper foreign key constraints

- Generates seed data for testing

**Result:** well-tested database schema files:

```text

migrations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001_create_users_table.sql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002_create_sessions_table.sql  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 003_create_audit_log_table.sql
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 004_add_indexes.sql

```text
text

#

#

# Step 4: Continue the Pattern

**API Development (Orchestrator ‚Üí Claude Code)**

1. Orchestrator plans endpoint structure and security patterns

2. Claude Code implements routes with proper validation

3. Automatic error handling and logging integration

4. Built-in rate limiting and security middleware

**Frontend Integration (Orchestrator ‚Üí Claude Code)**  

1. Orchestrator designs state management and UX flow

2. Claude Code creates React components with TypeScript

3. Implements secure token storage and refresh logic

4. Adds proper error boundaries and loading states

#

#

# Step 5: The Quality Advantage

**Testing (Orchestrator ‚Üí Claude Code)**

- Orchestrator designs comprehensive test strategy

- Claude Code implements unit, integration, and security tests

- Automated testing for authentication flows

- Security vulnerability testing included

**Documentation (Orchestrator ‚Üí Claude Code)**

- Orchestrator plans documentation structure for different audiences

- Claude Code generates API documentation with examples

- Creates setup guides and troubleshooting docs

- Includes security best practices guide

#

#

#

# Pattern 2: The "API Integration" Workflow

*Connecting to third-party services with resilience*

#

#

# Scenario

Integrate with Stripe payment processing, including webhooks, error handling, and reconciliation.

#

#

# The Orchestrated + Claude Code Approach

**Orchestrator Planning:**

1. Integration Architecture (architect) - webhook security, retry patterns

2. Core Implementation (implementer) - payment flows and error handling  

3. Webhook Processing (implementer) - event handling and validation

4. Testing Strategy (tester) - mock services and edge cases

5. Documentation (documenter) - integration guide and troubleshooting

**Claude Code Implementation:**

- Robust webhook validation with signature verification

- Exponential backoff retry logic for failed payments

- Comprehensive error categorization and handling

- Audit logging for compliance and debugging

- Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns

#

# Integration Optimization Tips

#

#

# Resource Coordination

**Problem:** Both systems trying to modify the same files
**Solution:** Use orchestrator for planning, Claude Code for execution

```text

1. Orchestrator: Plan file structure and modifications

2. Claude Code: Execute file operations with proper locking

3. Orchestrator: Verify and synthesize results

```text
text

#

#

# Context Sharing

**Best Practice:** Use project-level context files

```text

project-context.md  

# Shared context for both systems

#

#

# Performance Patterns

- **Parallel Execution:** Run independent subtasks simultaneously

- **Smart Caching:** Cache architecture decisions across sessions

- **Incremental Updates:** Update existing projects without full rebuild

#

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

#

#

# "Claude Code can't find my files"

**Cause:** Working directory mismatch
**Fix:** Ensure Claude Code working-directory matches project root

#

#

# "Orchestrator lost context between sessions"  

**Cause:** Session state not persisted
**Fix:** Use project-level context files and explicit status checks

#

#

# "Integration feels clunky"

**Cause:** Not using systematic handoff patterns
**Fix:** Always plan with orchestrator, then execute with Claude Code

#

# When This Pattern Works Best

‚úÖ **Multi-component features** requiring various expertise areas
‚úÖ **Complex integrations** with external services
‚úÖ **Quality-critical projects** where systematic coverage matters
‚úÖ **Learning scenarios** where you want to understand best practices
‚úÖ **Team environments** where consistency across developers is important
