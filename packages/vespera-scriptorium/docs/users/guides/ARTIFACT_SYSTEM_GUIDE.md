# Artifact System Usage Guide for MCP Task Orchestrator

#

# Overview

The MCP Task Orchestrator now includes an advanced artifact management system designed to solve context limit issues by storing detailed work in accessible files rather than streaming everything into the conversation context.

#

# How It Works

#

#

# Problem Solved

Previously, all specialist work was streamed directly into the chat context, causing:

- **Context limit issues** when multiple agents produced detailed output

- **Wasted context space** with repetitive or lengthy content

- **Lost work** when conversations hit token limits mid-completion

#

#

# Solution

The new system:

- **Stores detailed work** in `.task_orchestrator/artifacts/` directory

- **Mirrors file structure** to maintain organization

- **Links artifacts to tasks** in the database for easy retrieval

- **Provides summary-only** responses to save context space

#

# For Specialist Agents: Updated `complete_subtask` Usage

#

#

# NEW Required Parameters

When completing subtasks, **ALL specialist agents must now use these parameters**:

```json
{
  "task_id": "your_task_id",
  "summary": "Brief 1-2 sentence summary of what was accomplished",
  "detailed_work": "Full detailed content - code, documentation, analysis, etc.",
  "file_paths": ["path/to/file1.py", "path/to/file2.md"],  // Optional
  "artifact_type": "code",  // or "documentation", "analysis", etc.
  "next_action": "continue"
}

```text

#

#

# Parameter Details

**`summary`** (Required)

- Brief 1-2 sentence description for database/UI display

- Will appear in task progress and status reports

- Keep under 200 characters

- Example: "Implemented user authentication system with JWT tokens and password reset functionality"

**`detailed_work`** (Required)  

- **Full detailed content** of your work

- Code, documentation, analysis, design specifications, etc.

- **No length limit** - can be thousands of lines

- Will be stored as a markdown file in the artifacts directory

- Example: Complete code implementations, full analysis reports, comprehensive documentation

**`file_paths`** (Optional)

- List of original file paths you're referencing or creating

- Helps organize artifacts in mirrored directory structure

- Example: `["src/auth/login.py", "docs/api/authentication.md"]`

**`artifact_type`** (Optional, defaults to "general")

- Type of work being stored: `"code"`, `"documentation"`, `"analysis"`, `"design"`, `"test"`, `"config"`, `"general"`

- Helps with organization and retrieval

#

# Artifact Content Format

Each artifact file includes:

- **Header metadata** (task ID, type, creation date, summary)

- **Referenced files** section (if applicable)  

- **Detailed work** content

- **Footer** with generation timestamp

#

# Benefits for Specialists

#

#

# Context Efficiency

- **No more context waste** - detailed work stored separately

- **Faster responses** - only summaries in conversation

- **No length limits** - store as much detail as needed

#

#

# Better Organization

- **File structure mirroring** - maintains logical organization

- **Searchable artifacts** - easy to find previous work

- **Version tracking** - each artifact timestamped and linked

#

#

# Reliability

- **Never lose work** - artifacts persist even if conversation fails

- **Resume capability** - access previous work in new conversations  

- **Fallback support** - system gracefully handles failures

#

# Migration from Old System

#

#

# Backward Compatibility

The system supports the old parameter format for gradual migration:

```text
json
{
  "task_id": "task_id",
  "results": "Summary text", 
  "artifacts": ["file1.txt"],  // Legacy parameter
  "next_action": "continue"
}
```text

However, **all new work should use the enhanced format** for optimal context management.

#

#

# Transitioning Existing Work

- Old-style completions still work but don't get artifact benefits

- New artifact system only applies to tasks completed with new parameters

- Mixed usage is supported during transition period

#

# Error Handling

#

#

# Artifact Creation Failures

If artifact creation fails, the system:

1. **Logs the error** for debugging

2. **Falls back** to legacy completion method  

3. **Warns in response** that fallback was used

4. **Continues operation** without blocking task completion

#

#

# Recovery Options

- Check `.task_orchestrator/logs/` for error details

- Retry with different artifact parameters

- Use legacy format as temporary workaround

- Contact system administrator if persistent issues

#

# Best Practices for Specialists

#

#

# Summary Writing

- **Be concise** but descriptive

- **Focus on outcomes** rather than process

- **Include key metrics** or results where applicable

- **Avoid technical jargon** in summaries (save for detailed_work)

#

#

# Detailed Work Organization

- **Use clear headings** and structure

- **Include code examples** with proper syntax highlighting

- **Add explanations** for complex logic or decisions

- **Provide context** for why specific approaches were chosen

#

#

# File Path References

- **Use relative paths** when possible for portability

- **Include all relevant files** that were created or modified

- **Group related files** logically in the list

- **Use descriptive file names** that indicate purpose

#

# System Integration

#

#

# Database Links

- Each artifact is linked to its task in the database

- Artifact metadata stored for quick retrieval

- Task progress updated with artifact references

- Full audit trail maintained

#

#

# Retrieval Access

- Artifacts accessible via file system paths

- Task index files provide quick overview

- Metadata enables programmatic access

- Integration with task status and progress reporting

---

**This artifact system represents a major advancement in managing complex task orchestration while maintaining conversation efficiency. All specialist agents should adopt the new format to take advantage of these benefits.**
