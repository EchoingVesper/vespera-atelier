# Best Practices

Based on these examples, here are some best practices for using the MCP Task Orchestrator:

1. **Provide Detailed Task Descriptions**: The more specific your task description, the better the task breakdown will be.

2. **Include Relevant Context**: Adding context helps the orchestrator understand the specific requirements and constraints.

3. **Follow the Recommended Task Order**: The orchestrator suggests a task order that respects dependencies between subtasks.

4. **Embrace Specialist Roles**: When executing a subtask, fully embrace the specialist role provided by the orchestrator.

5. **Provide Comprehensive Results**: When completing a subtask, include detailed results and list all artifacts created.

6. **Track Progress**: Use the `orchestrator_get_status` tool to track progress and identify the next steps.

7. **Synthesize Results Properly**: After completing all subtasks, use the synthesis tool to create a cohesive summary.

For more detailed information, see the [Usage Guide](../usage.md) and [Configuration Guide](../configuration.md).
