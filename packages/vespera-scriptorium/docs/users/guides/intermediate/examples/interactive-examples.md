*Step-by-step examples you can follow along with immediately*

#

# Quick Start Examples

#

#

# Example 1: First Time Setup and Basic Usage

**Scenario**: You just installed the orchestrator and want to try it out.

**Step 1: Initialize Your First Session**

```text
Command: "Initialize a new orchestration session"

Expected Response:

- Session confirmation

- Available specialist roles listed

- Usage instructions provided

- Any interrupted tasks shown (if resuming)

```text

**Step 2: Create Your First Task Plan**

```text
text

Command: "Plan a simple Python script that reads a CSV file, processes the data, and generates a summary report"

What happens:

- LLM analyzes the request

- Creates 4-6 subtasks with appropriate specialists

- Returns parent_task_id and subtask list

- Suggests next steps

```text
text

**Step 3: Execute Your First Subtask**

```text

Command: "Execute the architect subtask [task_id_from_step_2]"

What you get:

- Architect specialist context and expertise

- System design guidance for CSV processing

- Approach and methodology recommendations

- Task-specific instructions

```text
text

**Step 4: Complete Your First Subtask**

```text

Command: "Complete the architect subtask [task_id] with summary: 'Designed modular CSV processing architecture with error handling', detailed work: '[your architecture document]', next action: continue"

Result:

- Task marked as completed

- Progress updated (e.g., 25% complete)

- Artifact created and stored

- Next recommended task suggested

```text
text

**Step 5: Check Progress and Run Maintenance**

```text

Command: "Check the status of all active tasks"
Then: "Use maintenance coordinator to scan and cleanup the current session"

You'll see:

- Current task progress

- System health status

- Any cleanup recommendations

```text
text

#

# Maintenance Coordinator Examples

#

#

# Example 2: Daily Maintenance Routine

**Morning Startup Routine:**

```text
bash

# 1. Initialize and check for interrupted work

"Initialize session and show any tasks I can resume"

# 2. If resuming work, check system health

"Use maintenance coordinator to validate structure of current session"

# 3. Clean up any stale items from yesterday

"Run maintenance scan and cleanup on current session with basic validation"

```text
text

**End of Day Routine:**

```text
bash

# 1. Complete any final tasks

"Complete subtask [id] with summary and prepare for handover"

# 2. Prepare comprehensive handover

"Use maintenance coordinator to prepare handover with comprehensive validation"

# 3. Check final status

"Show status of all tasks including completed ones"

```text
text

#

#

# Example 3: Performance Optimization Workflow

**When System Feels Slow:**

```text
bash

# Step 1: Diagnose the issue

"Check status and show system health metrics"

# Step 2: Run comprehensive cleanup

"Use maintenance coordinator with action scan_cleanup, scope full_project, validation_level comprehensive"

# Step 3: Review recommendations

"Show me the maintenance recommendations from the last scan"

# Step 4: Validate improvements

"Run structure validation on full project with basic validation"

```text
text

**Expected Results:**

- Task count reduction (stale tasks archived)

- Performance improvement recommendations

- Database optimization suggestions

- System health score improvement

#

#

# Example 4: Weekly Deep Maintenance

**Complete Weekly System Health Check:**

```text
python

# Week setup - run at start of work week

maintenance_schedule = {
    "action": "scan_cleanup",
    "scope": "full_project", 
    "validation_level": "comprehensive"
}

# Execute comprehensive scan

"Use maintenance coordinator to scan and cleanup the full project with comprehensive validation"

# Review and act on recommendations

"Show maintenance recommendations and help me prioritize actions"

# Validate system health after cleanup

"Run maintenance validation on full project with full audit level"

```text

#

# Troubleshooting Scenarios

#

#

# Example 8: Handling Stale Tasks

**Scenario**: You notice tasks that have been "active" for days but aren't progressing.

**Diagnostic Workflow:**

```text
python

# Step 1: Identify the issue

"Check status of all tasks including completed ones"

# Step 2: Run comprehensive scan

"Use maintenance coordinator to scan and cleanup full project with comprehensive validation"

# Expected output analysis:

"""
{
  "stale_tasks_found": 3,
  "stale_tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "implementer_abc123",
      "age_hours": 72.5,
      "status": "active",
      "title": "Database integration implementation"
    }
  ]
}
"""

# Step 3: Review and decide

"Show me details about the stale tasks and recommendations for resolution"

# Step 4: Clean resolution

"Use maintenance coordinator with scan_cleanup action to archive stale tasks"

```text
text

**Prevention Strategy:**

```text
python

# Daily habit - prevent stale tasks

daily_maintenance = """
Use maintenance coordinator to:

1. Scan current session with basic validation

2. Review any tasks active > 24 hours  

3. Complete or archive tasks that aren't progressing
"""

```text
text

#

#

# Example 9: Database Performance Issues

**Scenario**: System is responding slowly, many tasks in database.

**Resolution Workflow:**

```text
python

# Step 1: Diagnose system health

"Check system status and run maintenance structure validation"

# Step 2: Performance analysis

"Use maintenance coordinator to scan full project with comprehensive validation"

# Typical findings:

"""
{
  "total_tasks": 150,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "performance_optimization",
      "priority": "high",
      "description": "150 tasks exceed recommended limit of 100"
    }
  ]
}
"""

# Step 3: Systematic cleanup

"Run comprehensive cleanup on full project to archive completed workflows"

# Step 4: Validate improvements

"Check system status after cleanup and measure performance improvement"

# Step 5: Establish maintenance routine

"Set up weekly maintenance schedule to prevent future performance issues"

```text
text

#

#

# Example 10: Context Limit Prevention

**Scenario**: Working on large project, approaching context limits.

**Proactive Workflow:**

```text
python

# Before hitting limits - use artifacts effectively

task_completion_pattern = """
Complete subtask {task_id} with:
Summary: [Brief 1-2 sentence summary]
Detailed work: [Full implementation details - stored as artifact]
File paths: [All files created/modified]  
Artifact type: [code/documentation/analysis/design]
Next action: continue
"""

# Benefits:

"""

- Detailed work stored in filesystem, not conversation

- Context preserved for future sessions

- Full implementation accessible via artifact files

- Conversation stays focused on coordination
"""

# When approaching limits:

"Use maintenance coordinator to prepare handover with comprehensive validation"

# Result:

"""

- Complete handover documentation generated

- Temporary data cleaned up

- System optimized for continuation

- Clear resume instructions provided
"""

#

# Common Integration Patterns

#

#

# Example 11: CI/CD Integration Workflow

**Project**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipeline

```text
python

# Phase 1: Plan CI/CD architecture

"""Initialize orchestration and plan CI/CD pipeline setup:

    if task.endswith(["workflow setup", "automation", "guide"]):
        "Run maintenance scan to optimize system before next phase"

# Phase 4: Integration testing

"Synthesize CI/CD pipeline and run comprehensive validation"

```text

# Example 12: Team Handoff Pattern

**Scenario**: Transferring project to another team member.

**Complete Handoff Workflow:**

```text
python

# Step 1: Prepare comprehensive handover

"Use maintenance coordinator to prepare handover with comprehensive validation"

# Step 2: Generate status summary

"Show complete status of all tasks with progress details"
