# Migration Guide

#

# Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you previously installed MCP Task Orchestrator using the old methods, follow this guide to migrate to the unified installation system.

#

# Before You Start

**Backup your existing configurations** (optional but recommended):

- Claude Desktop: Copy `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

- Other clients: Copy relevant config files

#

# Migration Steps

#

#

# 1. Clean Up Old Installation

```bash

# This removes obsolete files automatically

python installer/cleanup.py

```text

#

#

# 2. Run New Unified Installer  

```text
bash
python install.py

```text

#

#

# 3. Verify Migration

```text
bash
python test_validation.py
```text

#

# What Gets Cleaned Up

The migration automatically removes:

- `install_bundled.py` (obsolete embedded Python approach)

- `install_for_claude.py` (obsolete single-client installer)

- `bundled/` directory (failed embedded Python)

- `temp_calculator_project/` (test files)

- Other obsolete installation files

#

# What's New

- **üéØ Single Command**: One installer for all clients

- **üîç Auto-Detection**: Finds installed clients automatically

- **üßπ Cleanup**: Removes obsolete files

- **üîß Better Error Handling**: Improved validation and testing

- **üìö Better Documentation**: Comprehensive guides

#

# Troubleshooting Migration

**"Configuration conflicts"**

- The new installer merges with existing configs safely

- Your existing MCP servers remain unchanged

**"Virtual environment issues"**  

- Delete `venv_mcp/` directory and reinstall

- The new installer creates a fresh environment

**"Missing tools after migration"**

- Restart all MCP client applications

- Check that `task-orchestrator` appears in tools list

#

# Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback:

1. Restore backed-up configuration files

2. Delete `venv_mcp/` directory

3. Use your previous installation method

The migration is designed to be safe and reversible.
