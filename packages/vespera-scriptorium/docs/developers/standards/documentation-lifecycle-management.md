# Documentation Lifecycle Management Standards

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive lifecycle management standards for documentation artifacts, incorporating 
preventive maintenance philosophy and automated cleanup schedules. These standards ensure documentation 
remains current, relevant, and valuable throughout its operational lifetime.

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Creation Stage
**Duration**: Initial development through first publication
**Characteristics**: High activity, frequent changes, intensive review
**Management Focus**: Quality gates, template compliance, initial validation

#### Quality Gates
- **Template compliance**: Must use approved document templates
- **Structure validation**: Required sections and formatting standards
- **Content review**: Domain expert validation before publication
- **Technical accuracy**: Code examples and technical content verification

#### Retention Policy
- **Draft artifacts**: Retained for 30 days after publication
- **Review artifacts**: Retained for 90 days after publication
- **Version history**: Full history maintained during creation stage

### 2. Active Stage
**Duration**: Post-publication through regular usage period
**Characteristics**: Regular updates, active maintenance, user feedback
**Management Focus**: Currency, accuracy, user satisfaction

#### Maintenance Requirements
- **Currency checks**: Monthly validation of content accuracy
- **Link validation**: Weekly automated checking of external references
- **User feedback**: Quarterly review of user comments and suggestions
- **Usage analytics**: Monthly review of access patterns and effectiveness

#### Retention Policy
- **Active versions**: Current plus previous 2 versions retained
- **Change logs**: Complete change history maintained
- **User feedback**: Retained for 2 years for trend analysis
- **Analytics data**: Retained for 1 year for optimization

### 3. Maintenance Stage
**Duration**: Reduced activity period with periodic updates
**Characteristics**: Infrequent updates, stability focus, long-term value
**Management Focus**: Stability, minimal necessary changes, cost efficiency

#### Maintenance Triggers
- **Critical updates**: Security issues, breaking changes
- **User requests**: Documented user needs or pain points
- **Dependency changes**: Updates to referenced systems or processes
- **Periodic review**: Annual comprehensive review

#### Retention Policy
- **Maintained versions**: Current plus previous version only
- **Change logs**: Last 2 years of changes retained
- **User feedback**: Critical feedback retained, routine feedback archived
- **Analytics data**: Quarterly summaries retained

### 4. Archive Stage
**Duration**: End of active use through potential future reference
**Characteristics**: Read-only, historical reference, minimal maintenance
**Management Focus**: Accessibility for historical reference, storage efficiency

#### Archive Triggers
- **Obsolescence**: Replaced by newer documentation
- **Technology sunset**: Documented technology no longer supported
- **Process change**: Documented processes no longer used
- **Regulatory requirement**: Must retain for compliance purposes

#### Retention Policy
- **Archive versions**: Final version plus critical historical versions
- **Metadata**: Complete lifecycle metadata retained
- **Access logs**: Basic access tracking for archive justification
- **Review schedule**: Annual archive review for continued retention need

### 5. Disposal Stage
**Duration**: Final deletion after retention period
**Characteristics**: Secure deletion, compliance verification, audit trail
**Management Focus**: Compliance, security, proper disposal documentation

#### Disposal Triggers
- **Retention expiration**: Legal/policy retention period exceeded
- **Business decision**: No longer needed for any business purpose
- **Privacy requirements**: Personal data must be deleted
- **Storage optimization**: Archive storage capacity management

#### Disposal Process
- **Review approval**: Management approval required for disposal
- **Audit trail**: Complete disposal record maintained
- **Secure deletion**: Multi-pass deletion for sensitive content
- **Compliance verification**: Legal/regulatory requirement verification

## Artifact Type Classifications

### 1. Critical Documentation
**Examples**: API documentation, security procedures, compliance documents
**Retention**: Extended retention periods, enhanced backup requirements
**Review Frequency**: Monthly active review, quarterly maintenance review
**Disposal Requirements**: Legal review required before disposal

### 2. Standard Documentation
**Examples**: User guides, process documentation, technical specifications
**Retention**: Standard retention periods, regular backup requirements
**Review Frequency**: Quarterly active review, annual maintenance review
**Disposal Requirements**: Management approval required

### 3. Temporary Documentation
**Examples**: Meeting notes, draft documents, project-specific artifacts
**Retention**: Short retention periods, basic backup requirements
**Review Frequency**: Annual review for continued need
**Disposal Requirements**: Automatic disposal after retention period

### 4. Historical Documentation
**Examples**: Archived specifications, deprecated procedures, legacy systems
**Retention**: Long-term retention for historical reference
**Review Frequency**: Annual review for continued relevance
**Disposal Requirements**: Historical significance review required

## Automated Cleanup Schedules

### Daily Automation
- **Temporary file cleanup**: Remove files older than 24 hours from temp directories
- **Draft cleanup**: Archive drafts inactive for 7 days
- **Link validation**: Check all external links in active documentation
- **Backup verification**: Verify successful completion of nightly backups

### Weekly Automation
- **Inactive content identification**: Flag documentation with no access in 30 days
- **Version cleanup**: Remove intermediate versions older than 7 days
- **Orphan detection**: Identify documents not linked from any navigation
- **Storage monitoring**: Track storage usage and growth trends

### Monthly Automation
- **Currency validation**: Check last-modified dates against review schedules
- **User analytics**: Generate usage reports for all documentation
- **Quality metrics**: Calculate and report documentation health indicators
- **Archive candidate identification**: Flag content for potential archiving

### Quarterly Automation
- **Comprehensive review**: Full lifecycle stage assessment for all documents
- **Retention policy enforcement**: Apply retention rules and archive/dispose content
- **Stakeholder notifications**: Notify owners of documents requiring attention
- **Process optimization**: Analyze lifecycle data for process improvements

## Preventive Maintenance Philosophy

### Proactive Approach
Rather than waiting for problems to occur, we implement systematic preventive measures:

#### Content Freshness
- **Automatic staleness detection**: Flag content approaching review dates
- **Dependency tracking**: Monitor changes to referenced systems and content
- **User feedback integration**: Proactive response to user-identified issues
- **Predictive maintenance**: Use analytics to predict maintenance needs

#### Quality Preservation
- **Continuous validation**: Ongoing automated quality checks
- **Degradation prevention**: Proactive measures to prevent quality decline
- **Standard enforcement**: Consistent application of quality standards
- **Improvement integration**: Regular integration of quality improvements

#### System Health
- **Performance monitoring**: Track system performance and user experience
- **Capacity planning**: Proactive management of storage and processing capacity
- **Security maintenance**: Regular security updates and vulnerability assessment
- **Disaster preparedness**: Comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
