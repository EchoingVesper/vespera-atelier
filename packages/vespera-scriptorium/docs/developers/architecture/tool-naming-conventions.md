# Tool Naming Conventions and Architecture

*Architectural analysis and recommendations for MCP Task Orchestrator tool naming*

#

# Current Tool Naming Analysis

#

#

# Existing Tool Names

1. `orchestrator_initialize_session` - Session setup

2. `orchestrator_plan_task` - Task breakdown creation

3. `orchestrator_execute_subtask` - Specialist execution

4. `orchestrator_complete_subtask` - Task completion

5. `orchestrator_synthesize_results` - Result combination

6. `orchestrator_get_status` - Progress checking

7. `orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator` - Automated maintenance

#

# Architectural Analysis

#

#

# Current Naming Strengths

- **Consistent Prefix**: All tools use `orchestrator_` prefix for clear namespace separation

- **Logical Grouping**: Tools follow a workflow-oriented sequence

- **Descriptive Names**: Most names clearly indicate their function

- **MCP Compatibility**: Names work well within MCP protocol constraints

#

#

# Identified Issues

#

#

#

# 1. Length and Verbosity

**Problem**: Some tool names are unnecessarily long

- `orchestrator_initialize_session` (27 characters)

- `orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator` (32 characters)

**Impact**: 

- Reduced discoverability in tool lists

- Increased cognitive load for users

- More typing for manual invocation

#

#

#

# 2. Inconsistent Action Verbs

**Problem**: Mixed verb tenses and patterns

- `initialize` vs `plan` vs `execute` vs `get`

- Some use gerunds (`initialize`), others use imperatives (`plan`)

#

#

#

# 3. Semantic Clarity Issues

**Problem**: Some names don't clearly convey their purpose

- `initialize_session` - Could be clearer about workflow orchestration

- `maintenance_coordinator` - Doesn't indicate it performs actions

#

#

#

# 4. Workflow Sequence Clarity

**Problem**: Names don't clearly indicate workflow order

- Users may not understand the logical sequence

- No indication of dependencies between tools

#

# Proposed Naming Architecture

#

#

# Design Principles

1. **Brevity with Clarity**: Shorter names that remain descriptive

2. **Consistent Verb Patterns**: Use imperative verbs for actions

3. **Workflow Ordering**: Names should suggest natural sequence

4. **Domain Alignment**: Match user mental models of orchestration

#

#

# Naming Convention Framework

```text
orchestrator_<action>_<object>

```text

Where:

- `action`: Imperative verb (start, create, run, complete, check, maintain)

- `object`: Clear noun describing what is acted upon

#

#

# Alternative Naming Schemes

#

#

#

# Option A: Action-Focused (Recommended)

```text

orchestrator_start_workflow      

# vs orchestrator_initialize_session

orchestrator_create_plan         

# vs orchestrator_plan_task  

orchestrator_run_subtask         

# vs orchestrator_execute_subtask

orchestrator_complete_subtask    

# (no change - already good)

orchestrator_synthesize_results  

# (no change - clear purpose)

orchestrator_check_status        

# vs orchestrator_get_status

orchestrator_maintain_system     

# vs orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator

```text

#

#

#

# Option B: Workflow-Focused

```text

orchestrator_begin_session      

# vs orchestrator_initialize_session

orchestrator_break_down_task     

# vs orchestrator_plan_task

orchestrator_execute_subtask    

# (no change)

orchestrator_complete_subtask   

# (no change)

orchestrator_combine_results    

# vs orchestrator_synthesize_results

orchestrator_show_progress      

# vs orchestrator_get_status

orchestrator_cleanup_system     

# vs orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator

```text

#

#

#

# Option C: Minimal Change

```text

orchestrator_start_session      

# vs orchestrator_initialize_session

orchestrator_plan_task          

# (no change)

orchestrator_execute_subtask    

# (no change)

orchestrator_complete_subtask   

# (no change)

orchestrator_synthesize_results 

# (no change)

orchestrator_get_status         

# (no change)

orchestrator_maintain_system    

# vs orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator

```text

#

# Recommended Changes

#

#

# Phase 1: High-Impact, Low-Risk Changes

#

#

#

# 1. `orchestrator_initialize_session` → `orchestrator_start_workflow`

**Rationale:**

- Shorter (27 → 24 characters)

- More intuitive for users ("start" vs "initialize")

- Better reflects purpose (starting a workflow, not just a session)

- Aligns with common UX patterns

#

#

#

# 2. `orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator` → `orchestrator_maintain_system`

**Rationale:**

- Significantly shorter (32 → 25 characters)

- Action-oriented ("maintain" is a clear verb)

- Removes unnecessary complexity ("coordinator" doesn't add value)

- Matches user intent (they want to maintain the system)

#

#

#

# 3. `orchestrator_get_status` → `orchestrator_check_status`

**Rationale:**

- More natural language ("check" vs "get")

- Consistent with action-oriented naming

- Slightly longer but more intuitive

#

#

# Phase 2: Optional Consistency Improvements

#

#

#

# 4. `orchestrator_plan_task` → `orchestrator_create_plan`

**Rationale:**

- Noun-focused rather than verb-object confusion

- Clearer about output (creates a plan)

- Consistent with other creation actions

#

#

#

# 5. `orchestrator_execute_subtask` → `orchestrator_run_subtask`

**Rationale:**

- Shorter and more conversational

- "Run" is more commonly used than "execute"

- Better aligns with developer terminology

#

# Implementation Strategy

#

#

# Backward Compatibility Approach

#

#

#

# Phase 1: Alias Implementation

1. **Add new tool names** while keeping old ones

2. **Update documentation** to show new names as primary

3. **Deprecation warnings** for old names in responses

4. **Migration period** of 6 months

#

#

#

# Phase 2: Migration Support

```text
python

# Example implementation strategy

TOOL_ALIASES = {
    "orchestrator_start_workflow": "orchestrator_initialize_session",
    "orchestrator_maintain_system": "orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator",
    "orchestrator_check_status": "orchestrator_get_status"
}

```text

#

#

#

# Phase 3: Legacy Removal

- Remove old tool names after migration period

- Clean up documentation

- Update all examples and guides

#

#

# Documentation Update Strategy

#

#

#

# Immediate Updates

1. **Primary documentation** shows new names

2. **Examples** use new naming conventions

1. **Rapid rollback capability** if issues arise

2. **Monitoring** for tool usage patterns

3. **Feedback collection** from early adopters

4. **Iterative improvements** based on usage data

#

# Future Naming Considerations

#

#

# Naming Convention Evolution

As the system grows, maintain consistency with established patterns:

```text

orchestrator_<action>_<object>
```text

Examples for future tools:

- `orchestrator_pause_workflow`

- `orchestrator_resume_workflow`

- `orchestrator_export_results`

- `orchestrator_import_plan`

#

#

# Versioning Strategy

- Consider semantic versioning for major naming changes

- Document breaking changes clearly

- Provide automated migration tools where possible

#

# Success Metrics

#

#

# Quantitative Measures

- **Adoption rate** of new tool names

- **Developer experience** improvements

- **Professional perception** of the tool

- **Consistency satisfaction** across documentation

#

# Conclusion

The proposed naming improvements offer significant benefits with manageable implementation complexity. The phased approach ensures backward compatibility while moving toward a more intuitive and consistent naming architecture.

#

#

# Recommended Priority Order

1. **High Impact**: `orchestrator_start_workflow` and `orchestrator_maintain_system`

2. **Medium Impact**: `orchestrator_check_status`

3. **Low Impact**: Optional consistency improvements

This architectural approach balances user experience improvements with implementation practicality, ensuring the tool naming evolution supports long-term system growth and user adoption.
