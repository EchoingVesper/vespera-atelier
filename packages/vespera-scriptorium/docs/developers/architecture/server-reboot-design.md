# Server Reboot System Architecture Design

#

# Overview

The in-context server reboot mechanism enables seamless MCP Task Orchestrator restarts without requiring client reconnection. This system preserves active tasks, database state, and client connections through a graceful shutdown and restart sequence.

#

# Core Components

#

#

# 1. State Serialization Layer

**Purpose**: Capture and restore complete server state across restarts
**Location**: `mcp_task_orchestrator/server/state_serializer.py`

**Responsibilities**:

- Serialize active tasks and orchestration state

- Preserve database connection state and pending transactions

- Save client connection metadata and protocol state

- Create atomic state snapshots with rollback capability

**Key Classes**:

```python
class ServerStateSnapshot:
    timestamp: datetime
    active_tasks: List[TaskBreakdown]
    pending_operations: List[dict]
    client_sessions: List[ClientSession]
    database_state: DatabaseState
    
class StateSerializer:
    async def create_snapshot() -> ServerStateSnapshot
    async def restore_from_snapshot(snapshot: ServerStateSnapshot)
    async def validate_snapshot(snapshot: ServerStateSnapshot) -> bool

#

# 2. Graceful Shutdown Coordinator

**Purpose**: Orchestrate clean server shutdown with state preservation
**Location**: `mcp_task_orchestrator/server/shutdown_coordinator.py`

**Responsibilities**:

- Suspend active tasks at safe checkpoints

- Close database connections gracefully

- Notify clients of impending restart

- Ensure all in-flight operations complete or rollback

**Shutdown Sequence**:

1. Enter maintenance mode (reject new requests)

2. Complete or suspend active operations

3. Serialize current state to disk

4. Close database connections

5. Shutdown server process

#

#

# 3. Restart Manager

**Purpose**: Handle server process restart and state restoration
**Location**: `mcp_task_orchestrator/server/restart_manager.py`

**Responsibilities**:

- Manage subprocess restart coordination

- Restore serialized state on startup

- Rebuild database connections

- Resume suspended tasks and operations

**Restart Sequence**:

1. Start new server process

2. Load and validate serialized state

3. Restore database connections

4. Resume suspended tasks

5. Enable client reconnections

#

#

# 4. Client Connection Bridge

**Purpose**: Maintain client connectivity during server restart
**Location**: `mcp_task_orchestrator/server/connection_bridge.py`

**Responsibilities**:

- Buffer client requests during restart

- Maintain connection state metadata

- Handle automatic reconnection protocol

- Preserve request/response context

#

# State Serialization Design

#

#

# Serialization Format

**File Location**: `.task_orchestrator/server_state/`
**Format**: JSON with binary attachments for efficiency
**Naming**: `server_state_{timestamp}.json`

```text
text
json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-06T12:00:00Z",
    "server_version": "1.4.1",
    "restart_reason": "configuration_update"
  },
  "active_tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "task_abc123",
      "status": "suspended",
      "checkpoint_data": {...},
      "specialist_context": {...}
    }
  ],
  "database_state": {
    "pending_transactions": [],
    "connection_metadata": {...},
    "integrity_checksum": "sha256..."
  },
  "client_sessions": [
    {
      "session_id": "client_123",
      "protocol_state": {...},
      "pending_requests": [...]
    }
  ]
}

#

# Task Suspension Strategy

**Checkpoint-Based Suspension**:

- Tasks suspend at natural breakpoints (between subtasks)

- Preserve current specialist context and progress

- Serialize intermediate artifacts and state

- Enable resumption without data loss

**Suspension States**:

- `RUNNING` → `SUSPENDED_SAFE` (at checkpoint)

- `SUSPENDED_SAFE` → `RUNNING` (post-restart)

- `SUSPENDED_ERROR` → Manual recovery required

#

# Database Connection Management

#

#

# Connection State Preservation

**Challenge**: SQLite connections cannot be serialized
**Solution**: Metadata-based reconnection

**Approach**:

1. Serialize connection parameters and state

2. Close connections gracefully before shutdown

3. Recreate connections from metadata on restart

4. Validate database integrity post-restart

#

#

# Transaction Handling

**In-Progress Transactions**:

- Complete short transactions before shutdown

- Rollback long-running transactions

- Serialize transaction state for replay

**Rollback Strategy**:

- Automatic rollback on shutdown timeout

- Transaction log for replay on restart

- Integrity checks before resuming operations

#

# Client Communication Protocol

#

#

# Restart Notification

**Pre-Shutdown Notification**:

```text
json
{
  "method": "notification",
  "params": {
    "type": "server_restart_pending",
    "restart_in_seconds": 5,
    "reason": "configuration_update",
    "session_preserved": true
  }
}

```text
text

**Post-Restart Confirmation**:

```text
json
{
  "method": "notification", 
  "params": {
    "type": "server_restart_complete",
    "session_restored": true,
    "preserved_context": {...}
  }
}

```text
text

#

#

# Reconnection Handling

**Client-Side Strategy**:

- Detect connection loss

- Implement exponential backoff retry

- Restore request context after reconnection

- Validate session integrity

**Server-Side Strategy**:

- Accept reconnection from known clients

- Restore client session state

- Resume processing from last checkpoint

- Provide status updates on recovery

#

# Error Recovery and Safety

#

#

# Failure Scenarios

**Serialization Failures**:

- Fallback to emergency shutdown without state preservation

- Log detailed error information for debugging

- Notify clients of state loss

**Restart Failures**:

- Automatic retry with degraded functionality

- Rollback to last known good state

- Manual intervention triggers

**State Corruption**:

- Integrity validation on startup

- Backup state files for recovery

- Safe mode operation with reduced features

#

#

# Safety Guarantees

**Data Integrity**:

- Atomic state snapshots

- Checksum validation

- Backup and recovery procedures

**Operation Safety**:

- Timeout protection for all operations

- Resource cleanup on failure

- No data loss for completed operations

#

# Integration Points

#

#

# MCP Protocol Extensions

**New Tool Functions**:

```text
python
orchestrator_restart_server(
    graceful: bool = True,
    preserve_state: bool = True,
    timeout: int = 30
) -> RestartStatus

orchestrator_health_check() -> HealthStatus
orchestrator_shutdown_prepare() -> ShutdownReadiness
orchestrator_reconnect_test() -> ConnectionStatus

#

# Existing System Integration

**StateManager Integration**:

- Extend existing persistence layer

- Add restart-aware state handling

- Preserve existing API compatibility

**Task Lifecycle Integration**:

- Add suspension/resumption states

- Integrate with existing task management

- Preserve specialist context across restarts

#

# Implementation Constraints

#

#

# File Size Limits

**Constraint**: Keep all implementation files under 500 lines
**Strategy**: 

- Split functionality across focused modules

- Use composition over inheritance

- Clear module boundaries and interfaces

#

#

# Performance Requirements

**Restart Time**: <5 seconds total restart cycle
**State Size**: Optimize for <10MB typical state snapshots
**Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint during operations

#

#

# Compatibility Requirements

**Client Compatibility**: Support all existing MCP clients
**Database Compatibility**: Maintain SQLite schema compatibility
**API Compatibility**: Preserve existing MCP tool interfaces

#

# Next Implementation Steps

1. **Create core modules** with basic structure and interfaces

2. **Implement state serialization** with basic task state support

3. **Add graceful shutdown** with minimal feature set

4. **Build restart coordination** with state restoration

5. **Add client communication** protocol extensions

6. **Comprehensive testing** across restart scenarios

#

# Security Considerations

**State File Security**:

- Restrict file permissions to server process only

- Encrypt sensitive state data

- Secure temporary file handling

**Process Security**:

- Validate restart requests and authorization

- Prevent restart loops and DoS attacks

- Audit restart events and reasons
