# MCP Task Orchestrator 2.0.0 Implementation Plan

**Document Type**: Release Implementation Plan  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-01-28  
**Target Release**: Q1 2025  
**Status**: Active Planning

#

# Executive Summary

MCP Task Orchestrator 2.0.0 represents a major architectural evolution, building on the completed Clean Architecture refactoring to deliver the Generic Task Model foundation. This release focuses on breaking changes that establish a unified task system while maintaining backward compatibility through migration layers.

#

# Release Justification

**Why 2.0.0 (Major Version Bump)**:

- Complete architectural refactoring (Clean Architecture + DI)

- Breaking API changes (Generic Task Model)

- Fundamental data model changes (unified task hierarchy)

- New MCP tool suite (v2.0 API)

#

# Implementation Strategy

#

#

# Core Principles

1. **Zero Data Loss**: All migrations must preserve existing data

2. **Backward Compatibility**: v1.x tools continue working via compatibility layer

3. **Incremental Rollout**: Features can be enabled progressively

4. **Clean Foundation**: Establish solid base for future A2A and advanced features

#

# Tier 1: Must-Have Features (Weeks 1-4)

#

#

# 1. Generic Task Model Integration (Week 1-2)

**Status**: Core models exist, need MCP integration

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Integrate existing `orchestrator/generic_models.py` with MCP server

- [ ] Implement new v2.0 MCP tools:
  - `orchestrator_create_generic_task` - Flexible task creation
  - `orchestrator_update_task` - Task editing capabilities  
  - `orchestrator_delete_task` - Task deletion
  - `orchestrator_cancel_task` - Task cancellation
  - `orchestrator_query_tasks` - Advanced filtering/search

- [ ] Database schema migration for Generic Task storage

- [ ] Validation and error handling for new models

**Key Technical Changes**:

- Replace dual TaskBreakdown/SubTask with unified GenericTask

- Support unlimited nesting depth through parent_id relationships

- Rich metadata system (tags, attributes, dependencies)

- Template-based task instantiation

#

#

# 2. Task Template System Foundation (Week 3)

**Status**: Planned, not implemented

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Database schema for task templates

- [ ] Template CRUD operations via MCP tools:
  - `orchestrator_create_template` - Template creation
  - `orchestrator_apply_template` - Instantiate tasks from template
  - `orchestrator_list_templates` - Template discovery

- [ ] Basic template validation and parameter substitution

- [ ] Essential workflow templates (feature development, code review, deployment)

**Template Examples**:

```yaml

# Feature Development Template

name: "Full-Stack Feature Implementation"
parameters:
  - feature_name: string
  - complexity: [simple, moderate, complex]
tasks:
  - name: "API Design for {feature_name}"
    type: "research"
    specialist: "architect"
  - name: "Backend Implementation"
    type: "implementation"
    depends_on: ["API Design"]
```text
text

#

#

# 3. Migration and Compatibility Layer (Week 4)

**Status**: Critical for zero-disruption upgrade

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Automatic data migration from v1.x to v2.0 schema

- [ ] Compatibility wrapper for all v1.x MCP tools

- [ ] Migration validation and rollback capabilities

- [ ] User migration guide and tooling

**Migration Strategy**:

- TaskBreakdown → GenericTask (type: "breakdown")

- SubTask → GenericTask (type: "standard", parent_id set)

- Preserve all existing data and relationships

- Gradual tool migration with deprecation warnings

#

# Tier 2: High-Value Additions (Week 5)

#

#

# 4. Enhanced MCP Tool Suite

**Status**: Missing critical management tools

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Advanced dependency management:
  - `orchestrator_add_dependency` - Create task dependencies
  - `orchestrator_remove_dependency` - Remove dependencies
  - `orchestrator_get_dependency_graph` - Visualize relationships

- [ ] Bulk operations:
  - `orchestrator_bulk_update` - Update multiple tasks
  - `orchestrator_archive_completed` - Archive finished work

- [ ] Enhanced querying:
  - Complex filtering (by status, type, specialist, tags)
  - Time-based queries (created/updated ranges)
  - Dependency-aware queries

#

#

# 5. Workspace Paradigm Completion

**Status**: 80% implemented, needs documentation completion

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Complete workspace detection and artifact placement

- [ ] Improved project root detection algorithms

- [ ] Enhanced `.task_orchestrator` directory management

- [ ] Workspace-aware template storage

#

# Tier 3: Foundation for Future (Week 6)

#

#

# 6. Enhanced Documentation and Testing

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Complete v2.0 API documentation

- [ ] Migration testing suite

- [ ] Performance benchmarking

- [ ] User adoption guides

#

#

# 7. Performance and Monitoring

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Generic Task Model performance optimization

- [ ] Enhanced metrics for new API usage

- [ ] Migration monitoring and reporting

#

# Risk Mitigation

#

#

# High-Risk Areas

1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Large task hierarchies, custom configurations

2. **API Compatibility**: Ensuring v1.x tools continue working

3. **Performance Impact**: New models might affect query performance

#

#

# Mitigation Strategies

1. **Extensive Migration Testing**: Test with real-world datasets

2. **Gradual Rollout**: Beta program with select users

3. **Comprehensive Backup**: Multiple backup layers during migration

4. **Quick Rollback**: Ability to revert to v1.x if issues arise
