#
# Historical Planning Documents

Archived planning documents are organized in `docs/archives/historical/planning/` with the following structure:

#
## v2.0-development/

**Superseded v2.0 planning documents (archived as implementation completed)**

- `Complete-2.0-Roadmap.md` - Original 6-week implementation timeline from January 2025

- `Mcp-Task-Orchestrator-2.0-Implementation-Plan.md` - Technical implementation details  

- `Integrated-Features-2.0-Roadmap.md` - Feature matrix with Vespera integration context

#
## completed/

**Completed planning initiatives (archived as objectives achieved)**

- `Root-Directory-Cleanup-Plan.md` - Project organization cleanup (completed)

- `Documentation-Organization-Plan.md` - Documentation restructuring (completed)

- `Next-Steps.md` - Historical next steps planning (superseded)

#
## specific-issues/

**Small specific implementation plans (archived as addressed)**

- `file-tracking-implementation-roadmap.md` - File tracking system implementation

#
# Document Consolidation Summary

This planning directory was created by consolidating 15 overlapping documents to:

**Resolve Status Conflicts**:

- Eliminated conflicting v2.0.0 status information through automated codebase analysis

- Established single source of truth with V2.0-Current-Status.md

- Archived outdated planning documents while preserving historical context

**Eliminate Content Duplication**:

- Merged Development-Cycle-Planning.md and Testing-Strategy.md into unified Development-Framework.md

- Consolidated Feature-Specifications.md, Version-Progression-Plan.md, and Missing-Mcp-Tools-Comprehensive.md into Feature-Roadmap.md

- Preserved unique documents (Improvement-Areas.md, Vespera-Atelier-Integration-Context.md) as standalone resources

**Improve Navigation**:

- Reduced file count from 15 to 5 focused documents (67% reduction)

- Created clear purpose-driven organization

- Established logical information hierarchy

#
# Document Maintenance Guidelines

#
## Single Responsibility Principle

Each document serves a specific purpose and should be maintained independently:

- **Status**: Current implementation state and immediate next steps

- **Framework**: Development processes and quality standards

- **Roadmap**: Future feature planning and version progression  

- **Improvement**: Enhancement methodology and technical debt management

- **Integration**: Architecture context for ecosystem integration

#
## Update Responsibilities

- **V2.0-Current-Status.md**: Update with each major milestone and release preparation

- **Development-Framework.md**: Review quarterly or when process improvements are identified

- **Feature-Roadmap.md**: Review quarterly with community feedback and technical discoveries

- **Improvement-Areas.md**: Update as new improvement opportunities are identified

- **Vespera-Atelier-Integration-Context.md**: Update when integration requirements evolve

#
## Cross-Reference Management

When updating documents, ensure internal links remain valid and refer to current document names. Historical references should link to archived documents in `docs/archives/historical/planning/`.

#
# Usage Guidelines

#
## For Developers

- Start with **V2.0-Current-Status.md** to understand current implementation state

- Reference **Development-Framework.md** for coding standards and testing requirements

- Consult **Feature-Roadmap.md** for future feature planning and API evolution

#
## For Project Planning

- Use **Feature-Roadmap.md** for release planning and timeline estimation

- Reference **Development-Framework.md** for sprint planning and quality gate requirements

- Consult **Improvement-Areas.md** for technical debt planning and code quality initiatives

#
## For Integration Work

- Review **Vespera-Atelier-Integration-Context.md** for architectural constraints and patterns

- Check **V2.0-Current-Status.md** for current capability and integration readiness

- Reference **Feature-Roadmap.md** for future integration opportunities
