While all development tasks are complete, the `orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator` tool returns `pending_implementation` status. This appears to be a deployment/activation issue rather than missing code. The implementation files exist:

- `mcp_task_orchestrator/orchestrator/maintenance.py`

- `mcp_task_orchestrator/orchestrator/task_lifecycle.py`

- Database models added to `mcp_task_orchestrator/db/models.py`

#

# 🚀 NEW PRIORITY: Subtask Isolation with Claude Code (RESEARCH PHASE)

#

#

# 💡 Breakthrough Concept  

**Revolutionary Enhancement**: Spawn isolated Claude Code instances for individual subtasks to achieve:

- **Context Multiplication**: Each subtask gets dedicated ~100k token context space

- **Scale Amplification**: Handle 5-10x larger projects through context partitioning  

- **Development Acceleration**: Persistent specialist sessions without context pollution

- **Context Immunity**: Build on proven streaming system for ultimate context limit resistance

#

#

# 📋 Feature Specification Status

- **Feature ID**: `SUBTASK_ISOLATION_CLAUDE_CODE_V1`

- **Location**: `docs/prompts/features/proposed/[RESEARCH]_subtask_isolation_claude_code.md`

- **Priority**: High (2.0 release acceleration)

- **Estimated Effort**: 6-8 weeks

- **Status**: Research phase - empirical testing needed

#

#

# 🎯 Immediate Research Questions

1. **Context Handling**: Does Claude Code actually handle context limits better than Claude Desktop?

2. **Isolation Effectiveness**: How much context efficiency gain from specialist isolation?

3. **Implementation Complexity**: What's the development overhead vs. benefit ratio?

4. **User Experience**: Does this enhance or complicate the development workflow?

#

#

# 🔬 Proposed Research Approach

**Phase 1**: Proof of concept with file-based communication using existing artifact system  
**Phase 2**: Empirical testing comparing context usage patterns across execution methods  
**Phase 3**: Real-world development project testing to validate scale improvements  

#

#

# 💪 Strategic Rationale

**Why This Matters**:

- Current streaming system solves data persistence across context resets

- Subtask isolation could solve context *capacity* limits entirely

- Combined: Could enable arbitrarily large AI-assisted development projects

- **Competitive advantage**: Unique capability for Large-scale development workflows

#

#

# ⚡ Implementation Strategy

**Leverage Existing Infrastructure**:

- ✅ Artifact system already handles cross-context communication perfectly

- ✅ Task orchestration framework provides subtask management

- ✅ Specialist system defines isolated context requirements

- 🆕 Add: Process management, file-based communication, session monitoring

**Timeline Consideration**:

- **Delay 2.0 release by ~2 months** BUT

- **Significantly accelerate 2.0 development** through context isolation

- **Net result**: Faster overall delivery + revolutionary capability
