# Daily Development Workflow

```text

Daily Workflow:
├── 09:00 - Daily Standup (15 min async check-in)
├── 09:15 - Focused development work
├── 12:00 - Lunch and informal collaboration

├── 16:00 - Documentation and learning time
└── 17:00 - End of core hours (flexible for async team)

```text

#

#

#

# Daily Standup Format

Each team member reports:

1. **Yesterday**: What did you complete?

2. **Today**: What will you work on?

3. **Blockers**: Any impediments or help needed?

4. **Sprint Goal**: How does your work contribute to sprint goal?
