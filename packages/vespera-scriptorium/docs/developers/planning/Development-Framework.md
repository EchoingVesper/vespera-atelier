# Testing Strategy

#
## Testing Philosophy

Our testing strategy emphasizes confidence, quality, and maintainability while supporting rapid development cycles. We adopt a risk-based testing approach that prioritizes critical functionality and user workflows.

**Core Principles**:

- **Shift Left**: Testing integrated early in development cycle

- **Pyramid Structure**: Balanced distribution across test types

- **Risk-Based**: Focus on high-impact, high-risk areas

- **Automation First**: Maximize automated coverage

- **Continuous Feedback**: Fast feedback loops for developers

#
## Testing Pyramid

│   ├── Component interaction validation
│   ├── Database and external service integration
│   └── API contract testing
└── End-to-End Tests (10% of testing effort)
    ├── Critical user journey validation
    ├── Performance and load testing
