# üèóÔ∏è Enhanced Session Management Architecture

**Document Type**: Architecture Design Specification  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-06-01  
**Status**: [CRITICAL] - Required for fixing usability-blocking issues  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking Issue #36 (Working Directory Detection)  
**Updated**: 2025-06-08 - Moved to CRITICAL due to production issues  
**Scope**: Complete session management architecture with database, persistence, and tool integration

#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE

**This feature has been elevated to CRITICAL status due to production-blocking issues:**

- **Issue #36**: Orchestrator files created in wrong directory

- **User Impact**: Users cannot control where .task_orchestrator folder is created

- **Required Fix**: Session-directory association with persistent session management

The `working_directory` parameter has been added to `orchestrator_initialize_session` as an immediate fix, but full session management with directory persistence is required for a complete solution.

#
# üéØ Executive Summary

#
# Architectural Vision

Transform the MCP Task Orchestrator from a task-focused system into a **session-aware organizational framework** where:

- **Sessions** represent large, cohesive project units (comparable to GitHub repositories or project workspaces)

- **Tasks** become components within sessions, organized hierarchically

- **One active session** provides focused context and eliminates cognitive overhead

- **Bi-directional persistence** ensures human-readable project organization

- **Mode-based specialization** adapts orchestrator behavior to project types

#
# Core Architectural Principles

1. **Session-First Design**: All orchestration operations occur within session context

2. **Single Active Session**: Only one session active at a time for focused execution

3. **Hierarchical Organization**: Sessions ‚Üí Task Groups ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Subtasks

4. **Dual Persistence**: Database performance + Human-readable markdown files

5. **Mode-Driven Behavior**: Session-linked specialist role configurations

6. **Graceful Migration**: Backward compatibility with existing task-only workflows

# Module Organization

This architecture specification is organized into focused modules:

- **[Architecture Specification](architecture-specification.md)** - Core components and system design

- **[Database Design](database-design.md)** - Schema, indexes, and data model

- **[Session State Management](session-state-management.md)** - Lifecycle and state machine

- **[Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md)** - MCP tools and integration details

- **[Migration & Operations](migration-operations.md)** - Performance, security, migration strategy

#
# Key Benefits

- **Claude Code Compatible**: Each module under 500 lines

- **Focused Context**: Separate concerns for easier understanding

- **Cross-Referenced**: Linked modules maintain architectural coherence

- **Implementation-Ready**: Clear separation of concepts, procedures, and reference materials
