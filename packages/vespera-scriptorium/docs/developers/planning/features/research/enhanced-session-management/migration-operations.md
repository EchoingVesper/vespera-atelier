# Migration Strategy and Operations

This document outlines performance considerations, security measures, error handling, and migration strategy for Enhanced Session Management.

#
# Performance Considerations

#
## Database Optimization Strategies

1. **Session Caching**: Cache active session context in memory
- Reduces database queries for frequent session operations
- Invalidate cache on session state changes
- Implement cache warming for session activation

2. **Lazy Loading**: Load task groups and tasks on demand
- Avoid loading entire session hierarchy upfront
- Use pagination for large task lists
- Implement smart prefetching based on usage patterns

3. **Materialized Paths**: Efficient hierarchy queries using path strings
- Store hierarchy path as string for fast queries
- Enable single-query retrieval of task subtrees
- Optimize for common hierarchy traversal patterns

4. **Connection Pooling**: Maintain pool of database connections
- Reduce connection establishment overhead
- Configure pool size based on expected concurrency
- Implement connection health monitoring

5. **Bulk Operations**: Batch task operations for better performance
- Group multiple task updates into single transaction
- Use batch inserts for task creation
- Optimize progress calculation updates

#
## File System Optimization

1. **Debounced Sync**: Batch markdown updates to reduce I/O
- Collect multiple changes before writing
- Use configurable debounce interval (default: 5 seconds)
- Implement immediate sync for critical changes

2. **Change Detection**: Monitor only active session files
- Reduce file system monitoring overhead
- Focus on currently relevant files
- Implement selective monitoring activation

3. **Compression**: Compress archived session data
- Reduce storage requirements for long-term archives
- Use standard compression algorithms (gzip, lz4)
- Maintain original format for active sessions

4. **Caching**: Cache parsed markdown content
- Avoid repeated parsing of unchanged files
- Use content hash for change detection
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation

#
## Memory Management

1. **Session Context Lifecycle**: Clear inactive session contexts
- Remove session data from memory when paused
- Implement configurable memory retention policies
- Use weak references for session objects

2. **Task Tree Pruning**: Limit in-memory task tree depth
- Prevent memory exhaustion with deep hierarchies
- Implement configurable depth limits
- Use lazy loading for deep subtrees

3. **Garbage Collection**: Regular cleanup of orphaned objects
- Remove unreferenced task objects
- Clean up expired sync states
- Implement periodic memory cleanup cycles

#
# Security and Error Handling

#
## Security Considerations

1. **Path Validation**: Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Validate all file paths before operations
- Restrict access to .task_orchestrator directory tree
- Sanitize user-provided path components

2. **File Permissions**: Secure .task_orchestrator directory access
- Set restrictive permissions (user-only access)
- Prevent unauthorized file system access
- Implement permission validation on startup

3. **Session Isolation**: Prevent cross-session data access
- Validate session ownership for all operations
- Enforce session context in database queries
- Implement access control for session operations

4. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs from markdown files
- Sanitize markdown content before parsing
- Validate task status changes
- Prevent injection attacks through user content

#
## Error Recovery Strategies

1. **Session Corruption Recovery**: Rebuild session from markdown backup
- Maintain automatic backup copies
- Implement session reconstruction from markdown
- Provide manual recovery procedures

2. **Database Recovery**: Restore from last known good state
- Maintain transaction rollback capabilities
- Implement checkpoint-based recovery
- Provide database repair utilities

3. **Sync Conflict Resolution**: Multiple resolution strategies
- Automatic resolution for simple conflicts
- User prompts for complex conflicts
- Maintain conflict history for debugging

4. **Mode File Recovery**: Fallback to default mode if custom mode fails
- Validate mode files before activation
- Maintain default mode as fallback
- Implement mode repair procedures

#
# Migration Strategy

#
## Phase 1: Database Schema Migration

**Objective**: Establish foundation for session-aware operations while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Tasks**:

- Add new tables while preserving existing ones

- Migrate existing tasks to default session

- Establish backward compatibility layer

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create new session-related tables

2. Add session_id column to existing tasks table (nullable initially)

3. Create default session for existing tasks

4. Update existing tasks with default session_id

5. Deploy compatibility adapter for legacy operations

**Success Criteria**:

- All existing functionality continues to work

- New tables created successfully

- Existing tasks migrated to default session

- No data loss during migration

#
## Phase 2: Session Management Introduction

**Objective**: Enable session creation and management capabilities.

**Tasks**:

- Enable session creation and management

- Maintain single active session concept

- Add markdown file generation

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Deploy session management MCP tools

2. Implement session state machine

3. Add markdown file generation

4. Enable session switching functionality

5. Deploy single active session enforcement

**Success Criteria**:

- Users can create and manage sessions

- Markdown files generated correctly

- Session switching works reliably

- Single active session constraint enforced

#
## Phase 3: Enhanced Features

**Objective**: Implement advanced session features and bi-directional synchronization.

**Tasks**:

- Full bi-directional sync implementation

- Advanced task group management

- Mode system integration

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Deploy bi-directional sync engine

2. Implement task group management

3. Add mode system integration

4. Deploy advanced MCP tools

5. Implement A2A framework integration

**Success Criteria**:

#
## Phase 4: Legacy Deprecation

**Objective**: Complete transition to session-aware operations and optimize performance.

**Tasks**:

- Gradual removal of task-only operations

- Full session-aware operation

- Performance optimization

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Deprecate legacy MCP tools

2. Remove backward compatibility layer

3. Optimize database schema

4. Implement performance enhancements

5. Complete migration to session-first design

**Success Criteria**:

- All operations session-aware

- Legacy compatibility removed

- Performance benchmarks met

- Clean architecture achieved
