# üîß Feature Specification: Task Visualizer Dashboard

**Feature ID**: `TASK_VISUALIZER_V2`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: User Experience  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-8 weeks  
**Created**: 2025-06-06  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Target Release**: v2.0.0 (Post Generic Task Model)

#

# üìã Overview

Add a comprehensive task visualization and monitoring dashboard to the MCP Task Orchestrator, providing users with real-time insights into task progress, specialist workload, and system performance. This feature addresses the current gap in user-friendly task tracking and monitoring capabilities.

**Problem Statement**: Users currently lack visibility into orchestrator task status beyond basic CLI output, making it difficult to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and manage complex workflows effectively.

**Solution**: Extend the existing MCP tool ecosystem with specialized visualization tools that provide dashboard data, real-time updates, advanced filtering, and performance analytics.

#

# üéØ Objectives

1. **Enhanced Task Visibility**: Provide comprehensive real-time view of all task states, progress, and dependencies

2. **User Experience Improvement**: Transform basic status data into intuitive, actionable dashboard information

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Enable tracking of specialist workload, system efficiency, and bottleneck identification

4. **Integration Readiness**: Design for seamless integration with planned v2.0.0 features (Generic Task Model, Session Management, Smart Routing)

5. **Scalability Foundation**: Support future multi-session and team collaboration features
