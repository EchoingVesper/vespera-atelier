**Document Type**: Research & Investigation  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Research Phase  
**Target Release**: v2.1.0

#

# Executive Summary

This document outlines research requirements for implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities in the MCP Task Orchestrator. The goal is to transform the orchestrator from a workflow tool into an intelligent knowledge management system that learns from past tasks, artifacts, and solutions.

#

# Research Objectives

#

#

# Primary Goals

1. **Semantic Search**: Enable natural language search across tasks and artifacts

2. **Knowledge Persistence**: Build organizational memory from completed work

3. **Intelligent Suggestions**: Provide context-aware recommendations

4. **Zero Maintenance**: Fully automatic background operation

#

#

# Success Criteria

- Lightweight, embedded solution (no external servers)

- Sub-second query response times

- Automatic indexing without user intervention

- Minimal resource overhead (<100MB memory, <500MB disk)

- Python-native or excellent Python bindings

#

# Research Areas

#

#

# 1. Vector Database Evaluation

#

# 2. Knowledge Graph Options

#

#

#

# Lightweight Graph Storage

**NetworkX + SQLite**

```python

# Example approach

class LightweightKnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self, db_path):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
        self.db = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self._load_from_db()
    
    def add_relationship(self, from_task, to_task, relationship_type):
        self.graph.add_edge(from_task, to_task, type=relationship_type)
        self._persist_to_db()

```text

**Graph Database Alternatives**

- TinyDB + graph extension

- Pure Python graph implementations

- JSON-based graph storage

#

#

# 3. Hybrid RAG Frameworks

#

#

#

# LlamaIndex Evaluation

```text
text
python

# Research integration approach

from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.vector_stores import ChromaVectorStore

# Can this handle our artifact storage pattern?

# Performance with incremental updates?

# Memory footprint?

```text

#

#

#

# Langchain Assessment

- Overhead vs. benefits analysis

- Custom vs. framework approach

- Integration complexity

#

#

#

# Build vs. Buy Decision Matrix

| Factor | Build Custom | Use Framework |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Control | High | Medium |
| Complexity | High | Low |
| Maintenance | High | Medium |
| Features | Exactly what we need | May include bloat |
| Performance | Optimizable | Framework overhead |

#

#

# 4. Embedding Model Research

#

#

#

# Local Model Requirements

- Size: <500MB

- Speed: <50ms per embedding

- Quality: Good on technical content

- Resource usage: Minimal

#

#

#

# Candidates

```python

# all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (22M parameters, 80MB)

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Performance testing needed:

# - Embedding generation time

# - Memory usage

# - Quality on task descriptions

# - Quality on code artifacts

```text

#

#

# 5. Integration Architecture

#

#

#

# Background Processing Design

```python
class RAGBackgroundProcessor:
    def __init__(self, vector_db, embedding_model):
        self.vector_db = vector_db
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model
        self.processing_queue = Queue()
        self.worker_thread = Thread(target=self._process_queue)
        
    def index_artifact(self, artifact_id, content):
        """Queue artifact for background indexing"""
        self.processing_queue.put(('artifact', artifact_id, content))
        
    def index_task(self, task_id, task_data):
        """Queue task for background indexing"""
        self.processing_queue.put(('task', task_id, task_data))

```text

#

#

#

# Storage Schema Extensions

```text
sql
-- Vector storage alongside existing tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type TEXT, -- 'task' or 'artifact'
    entity_id TEXT,
    embedding BLOB, -- Serialized vector
    model_version TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (entity_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) 
        OR artifacts(id)
);

-- Knowledge graph edges
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS knowledge_edges (
    from_id TEXT,
    to_id TEXT,
    edge_type TEXT,
    weight REAL,
    metadata JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (from_id, to_id, edge_type)
);

    def index(self, id, text):
        self.embeddings[id] = self.model.encode(text)
        
    def search(self, query, k=5):
        query_embedding = self.model.encode(query)
