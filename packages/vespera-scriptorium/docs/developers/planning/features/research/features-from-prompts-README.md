# 🚀 Features Directory Organization

This directory manages feature specifications and implementation tracking for the MCP Task Orchestrator project.

#

# 📁 Directory Structure

#

#

# Current Structure (Recommended Improvements)

**Suggested Reorganization** for better clarity and workflow alignment:

```text
features/
├── README.md                    

# This file - organization guide

├── proposed/                    

# New feature ideas awaiting evaluation

│   ├── automation-maintenance-enhancement.md
│   └── [other proposed features]
├── approved/                    

# Features approved for development  

├── in-progress/                 

# Features currently being implemented

├── completed/                   

# Successfully implemented features

├── archived/                    

# Deprecated or cancelled features

└── templates/                   

# Feature specification templates

```text

**Rationale for Reorganization:**

- **Status-based lifecycle**: Clear progression from idea → implementation → completion

- **Workflow alignment**: Matches development lifecycle stages

- **Better discoverability**: Easier to find features by implementation status

- **Templates**: Standardize feature specification format

#

#

# Current vs. Proposed Mapping

- `new_features/` → `proposed/` (clearer intent)

- `low-priority_features/` → Use priority tags within specs instead

- `implemented_features/` → `completed/` (more precise)

- `archived_features/` → `archived/` (shorter, clearer)

#

# 📋 Feature Specification Standards

#

#

# Required Elements

- **Feature ID**: Unique identifier for tracking

- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low with rationale

- **Category**: Core Infrastructure/User Experience/Integration/etc.

- **Estimated Effort**: Time-based estimate

- **Status**: Proposed/Approved/In-Progress/Completed/Archived

- **Implementation Approach**: Phases and dependencies

- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes

#

#

# File Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case: `automation-maintenance-enhancement.md`

- Include feature category if needed: `core-automation-enhancement.md`

- Keep names descriptive but concise

#

# 🔄 Feature Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: New feature idea documented in `proposed/`

2. **Approved**: Reviewed and approved, moved to `approved/`

3. **In-Progress**: Active development, moved to `in-progress/`

4. **Completed**: Implementation finished, moved to `completed/`

5. **Archived**: Cancelled or deprecated, moved to `archived/`

#

# 🏷️ Priority and Categorization

Use tags within feature specifications instead of separate directories:

#

#

# Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical for core functionality or blocking other work

- **Medium**: Important but not urgent, planned for upcoming cycles

- **Low**: Nice to have, future consideration

#

#

# Categories

- **Core Infrastructure**: Database, server architecture, core tools

- **User Experience**: Documentation, interfaces, workflows  

- **Integration**: MCP server connections, external tool support

- **Performance**: Optimization, scalability improvements

- **Quality**: Testing, validation, maintenance automation

#

# 📊 Status Tracking

Consider adding a features index file or database integration to track:

- Feature dependencies and relationships

- Implementation progress and milestones

- Impact assessment and success metrics

- Cross-references to related tasks and documentation

**Maintenance**: This README should be updated when directory structure changes or new standards are established.
