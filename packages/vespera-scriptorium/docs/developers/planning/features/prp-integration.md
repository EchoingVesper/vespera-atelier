# PRP Integration with MCP Task Orchestrator

#

# Overview

This document outlines the integration of Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) with the MCP Task Orchestrator, creating a powerful synergy between structured prompt engineering and intelligent task orchestration.

#

# What are PRPs?

Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) are a structured methodology for AI-assisted development that combines:

- Traditional PRD elements (what to build, why)

- Comprehensive context (documentation, code examples, patterns)

- Implementation blueprints (detailed how-to instructions)

- Validation gates (tests, linting, type checking)

#

# Integration Benefits

#

#

# 1. Enhanced Task Planning

- PRPs provide detailed implementation context for each task

- Task breakdowns can be automatically generated from PRPs

- Validation loops ensure task completion quality

#

#

# 2. Improved Specialist Context

- Specialists receive rich context from PRP documentation

- Implementation patterns are clearly defined

- Success criteria are explicitly stated

#

#

# 3. Automated Validation

- PRP validation gates integrate with task completion

- Tests and checks run automatically

- Quality assurance is built into the workflow

#

# Architecture Integration Points

#

#

# 1. PRP-to-Task Conversion

```python

# Proposed integration in domain/services/task_breakdown_service.py

class PRPTaskBreakdownService:
    """Convert PRPs into orchestratable tasks"""
    
    def create_tasks_from_prp(self, prp_path: Path) -> List[Task]:
        """Parse PRP and create task hierarchy"""
        prp_content = self._parse_prp(prp_path)
        tasks = self._extract_tasks(prp_content)
        return self._enhance_with_context(tasks, prp_content)

```text

#

#

# 2. Enhanced Specialist Assignment

```text
python

# Extension to domain/services/specialist_assignment_service.py

class PRPEnhancedSpecialistAssignment:
    """Assign specialists with PRP context"""
    
    def assign_with_prp_context(self, task: Task, prp_section: str) -> Specialist:
        """Assign specialist with relevant PRP documentation"""
        specialist = self._select_specialist(task)
        specialist.context = self._extract_prp_context(prp_section)
        return specialist

```text

#

#

# 3. Validation Integration

```text
python

# New validation service

class PRPValidationService:
    """Run PRP validation gates"""
    
    def validate_task_completion(self, task: Task, prp_validation: dict) -> bool:
        """Execute PRP-defined validation steps"""
        for validation in prp_validation['gates']:
            if not self._run_validation(validation):
                return False
        return True

#

# Workflow Integration

#

#

# 1. PRP-Driven Development Flow

1. Create PRP using `/create-base-prp` command

2. Execute PRP with task orchestrator integration

3. Tasks are automatically created and assigned

4. Validation gates ensure quality at each step

5. Final synthesis combines all validated outputs

#

#

# 2. Task Enhancement with PRPs

- Each task can reference a PRP section

- Specialists receive PRP context automatically

- Validation is performed using PRP gates

- Results are stored as artifacts

#

#

# 3. Continuous Validation Loop

# Implementation Roadmap

#

#

# Phase 1: Basic Integration (Immediate)

- [x] Copy PRP tools and templates

- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with PRP references

- [x] Create integration documentation

- [ ] Add PRP references to task entities

#

#

# Phase 2: Task Generation (Short-term)

- [ ] Create PRP parser service

- [ ] Implement task extraction from PRPs

- [ ] Add PRP validation gate support

- [ ] Update task UI to show PRP associations

#

#

# Phase 3: Deep Integration (Medium-term)

- [ ] Automatic specialist context from PRPs

- [ ] PRP-driven validation loops

- [ ] Bi-directional sync (tasks update PRPs)

- [ ] PRP template generation from tasks

#

#

# Phase 4: Advanced Features (Long-term)

- [ ] AI-powered PRP generation from requirements

- [ ] Multi-PRP orchestration

- [ ] PRP versioning and evolution

- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines

#

# Usage Examples

#

#

# Example 1: Feature Development with PRP

```text
bash

# Create PRP for new feature

/create-base-prp implement user authentication with JWT

# Execute with task orchestrator

python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.orchestrate_prp \
    --prp PRPs/user-authentication.md \
    --auto-validate

# Monitor progress

python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.status --prp user-authentication

```text

#

#

# Example 2: Refactoring with PRP

```text
bash

# Create refactoring PRP

/spec-create-adv refactor database layer to repository pattern

# Execute with specialist assignment

python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.execute_prp \
    --prp PRPs/database-refactor.md \
    --specialist architect

# Validate results

python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.validate_prp \
    --prp PRPs/database-refactor.md
```text

#

# Best Practices

#

#

# 1. PRP Creation

- Use templates for consistency

- Include all necessary context

- Define clear validation gates

- Reference existing code patterns

#

#

# 2. Task Orchestration

- Map PRP sections to specific tasks

- Assign appropriate specialists

- Run validation at each milestone

- Store artifacts for context preservation

#

#

# 3. Quality Assurance

- Use PRP validation gates

- Implement progressive validation

- Document failures and fixes

- Iterate based on results

#

# Technical Considerations

#

#

# 1. Storage

- PRPs stored in `PRPs/` directory

- Active PRPs linked to task database

- Completed PRPs archived with results

- Version control for PRP evolution

#

#

# 2. Performance

- Lazy loading of PRP content

- Caching of parsed PRPs

- Efficient validation execution

- Parallel task processing

#

#

# 3. Security

- Validate file paths

- Restrict command execution

- Audit trail for all operations

#

# Future Enhancements

#

#

# 1. PRP Marketplace

- Share PRPs across projects

- Template library

- Best practice examples

- Community contributions

#

#

# 2. AI Enhancement

- Auto-generate PRPs from requirements

- Suggest improvements to PRPs

- Learn from successful patterns

- Predict validation failures

#

#

# 3. Integration Ecosystem
