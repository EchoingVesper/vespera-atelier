# üîß Feature Specification: Task Visualizer and Navigation System

**Feature ID**: `TASK_VISUALIZER_NAV_001`  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: User Experience  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Approved  

#

# üìã Overview

Develop human-readable interfaces (both GUI and CLI) for navigating and visualizing task orchestration artifacts, progress, and hierarchies. The current artifact storage system works well technically but lacks user-friendly navigation, making it difficult for users to understand what tasks exist, their status, and how to access detailed results.

#

# üéØ Objectives

1. **Human-Readable Task Navigation**: Enable users to easily browse active, completed, and archived orchestration tasks with intuitive interfaces

2. **Artifact Discovery and Access**: Provide clear pathways to locate and view detailed task artifacts without navigating complex file paths

3. **Progress Visualization**: Display task hierarchies, dependencies, and completion status in visual and text-based formats

4. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Ensure both web-based GUI and command-line interfaces work across different environments

5. **Integration with Existing Storage**: Maintain current artifact storage structure while adding navigation layers

#

# üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Implementation

#

#

# New Tools/Functions

- **`orchestrator_list_tasks`**: CLI-style task browsing with filtering and formatting options

- **`orchestrator_show_artifact`**: Human-readable artifact content display with metadata

- **`orchestrator_task_tree`**: Hierarchical task visualization with dependency mapping

- **GUI Endpoint**: Web interface for visual task exploration and artifact browsing

#

#

# Database Changes

- **Task Metadata Enhancement**: Add human-readable titles, descriptions, and categorization

- **Artifact Index Table**: Create searchable index linking tasks to artifacts with metadata

- **User Interface State**: Store UI preferences and navigation history

#

#

# Integration Points

- **MCP Server Extension**: Add visualization endpoints to existing server

- **Artifact Storage Layer**: Overlay navigation system on current `.task_orchestrator/artifacts/` structure

- **CLI Integration**: Extend existing CLI tools with navigation commands

- **Web Framework**: Integrate with potential future web dashboard

#

# üîÑ Implementation Approach

#

#

# Phase 1: CLI Navigation Interface (1 week)

- **Task Listing Commands**: Implement `orchestrator_list_tasks` with filtering by status, date, specialist type

- **Artifact Access**: Create `orchestrator_show_artifact` for viewing artifact contents

- **Basic Tree View**: Text-based task hierarchy display

- **Search Functionality**: Allow searching tasks by keywords, dates, or specialist types

#

#

# Phase 2: Metadata and Indexing (0.5 weeks)

- **Artifact Indexing System**: Create searchable metadata database for artifacts

- **Human-Readable Organization**: Generate task summaries and categorization

- **Cross-Reference System**: Link related tasks and artifacts

- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient querying for large task histories

#

#

# Phase 3: GUI Visualizer Component (1 week)

- **Web Interface**: Create responsive web interface for task visualization

- **Interactive Task Tree**: Visual hierarchy with expand/collapse functionality

- **Artifact Preview**: In-browser markdown rendering with syntax highlighting

- **Progress Dashboard**: Status overview with completion statistics and timelines

#

#

# Phase 4: Advanced Features (0.5 weeks)

- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports and summaries from task data

- **Filter and Search**: Advanced filtering by multiple criteria

- **Integration Hooks**: API endpoints for third-party tool integration

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure GUI works on various screen sizes

#

# üìä Benefits

#

#

# Immediate Benefits

- **Reduced Navigation Friction**: Users can quickly find and access task results without memorizing file paths

- **Better Task Understanding**: Clear visualization of what work has been completed and what's in progress

- **Improved Workflow**: Streamlined access to artifacts enhances productivity and decision-making

- **Enhanced User Adoption**: Lower barrier to entry for using orchestration features

#

#

# Long-term Benefits

- **Scalable Task Management**: Foundation for managing hundreds or thousands of orchestrated tasks

- **Analytics and Insights**: Data for understanding task patterns, specialist effectiveness, and user workflows

- **Third-Party Integration**: API foundation for connecting with project management and development tools

- **Documentation Generation**: Automated generation of project summaries and progress reports

#

# üîç Success Metrics

- **Task Discovery Time**: Reduce time to find specific task artifacts from 2-3 minutes to under 30 seconds

- **User Interface Adoption**: 90%+ of orchestration users utilize visualization tools instead of direct file access

- **CLI Usage**: CLI navigation commands account for 60%+ of artifact access operations

- **GUI Engagement**: Web interface shows average session duration of 5+ minutes with low bounce rate

- **Support Reduction**: 50% reduction in user questions about finding task results and artifacts

#

# üéØ Migration Strategy

#

#

# Backward Compatibility

- **Current Storage Preserved**: No changes to existing `.task_orchestrator/artifacts/` structure

- **Incremental Enhancement**: Add navigation layer without disrupting existing workflows

- **Legacy Access**: Direct file access remains available for power users and scripts

#

#

# User Transition

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce CLI commands first, then GUI components

- **Documentation Updates**: Update user guides to highlight new navigation capabilities

- **Training Materials**: Create quick-start guides for both CLI and GUI interfaces

#

# üìù Additional Considerations

#

#

# Risks and Mitigation

- **Performance Impact**: Large task histories may slow navigation
  - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, lazy loading, and efficient indexing

- **UI Complexity**: Too many features could overwhelm users
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure design with sensible defaults

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Additional components require ongoing maintenance
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on simple, robust implementations with comprehensive testing

#

#

# Dependencies

- **Current Artifact System**: Requires existing artifact storage to remain stable

- **Database Infrastructure**: Needs reliable SQLite performance for metadata operations

- **Web Framework**: GUI component may require lightweight web server capabilities

- **CLI Framework**: Command-line interface needs consistent argument parsing and output formatting

#

#

# Technical Architecture

- **CLI Implementation**: Extend existing orchestrator CLI with new commands

- **GUI Framework**: Lightweight web interface (Flask/FastAPI + vanilla JavaScript/htmx)

- **Database Schema**: New tables for artifact metadata and indexing

- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access to task and artifact data

---

**Next Steps**: 

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation with CLI navigation commands

2. Design database schema for artifact indexing and metadata

3. Create wireframes and user experience flows for GUI components

4. Establish testing strategy for both CLI and GUI interfaces
