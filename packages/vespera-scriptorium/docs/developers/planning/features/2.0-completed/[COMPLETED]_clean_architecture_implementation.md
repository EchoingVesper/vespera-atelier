# üîß Feature Specification: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Feature ID**: `CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_V1`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Category**: Core Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 weeks (Completed)  
**Created**: 2025-05-15  
**Status**: Completed  

#
# üìã Overview

A complete transformation of the MCP Task Orchestrator to follow Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles, creating a maintainable, testable, and extensible codebase with clear separation of concerns and dependency inversion.

#
# üéØ Objectives

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Implement rich domain models with business logic encapsulation

2. **Dependency Inversion**: All dependencies flow inward toward the domain layer

3. **Testability**: Enable comprehensive unit and integration testing through dependency injection

4. **Maintainability**: Create clear module boundaries and separation of concerns

5. **Extensibility**: Support future feature development through modular architecture

#
# üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Implementation

#
## New Architecture Layers (Implemented)

**Domain Layer** (`mcp_task_orchestrator/domain/`):

- Entities: Core business objects (Task, Specialist, OrchestrationSession)

- Value Objects: Immutable types (TaskStatus, SpecialistType, ExecutionResult)

- Services: Domain business logic (TaskBreakdownService, SpecialistAssignmentService)

- Repositories: Abstract data access interfaces

- Exceptions: Domain-specific error hierarchy

**Application Layer** (`mcp_task_orchestrator/application/`):

- Use Cases: Business workflow orchestration

- DTOs: Data transfer objects for clean boundaries

- Interfaces: External service contracts

**Infrastructure Layer** (`mcp_task_orchestrator/infrastructure/`):

- Database: SQLite repository implementations

- MCP Protocol: Request/response adapters

- Configuration: Environment-aware config management

- Monitoring: Health checks and diagnostics

- Error Handling: Centralized error processing

- Dependency Injection: Service container with lifetime management

**Presentation Layer** (`mcp_task_orchestrator/presentation/`):

- MCP Server: Clean architecture entry point

- CLI Interface: Command-line tools with health checks

#
## Database Changes (Implemented)
