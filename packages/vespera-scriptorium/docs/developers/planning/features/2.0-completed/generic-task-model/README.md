# ðŸ”§ Feature Specification: Generic Task Model Design

**Feature ID**: `GENERIC_TASK_MODEL_V1`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Category**: Core Architecture  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 weeks (Completed)  
**Created**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: Completed

#
# ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive redesign of the MCP Task Orchestrator's task model to create a more generic, flexible, and extensible system. The new design eliminates the artificial distinction between tasks and subtasks, introducing a unified, nestable task structure with support for chaining, templates, prerequisites, and advanced lifecycle management.

#
# Problem Statement

The current task orchestrator has several limitations:

- Fixed task model with hardcoded fields

- Separate "task" and "subtask" concepts create unnecessary complexity

- No support for task chaining or complex dependencies

- Limited extensibility without modifying core code

- No template system for repeatable workflows

- Inadequate lifecycle management and supersession detection

#
# Proposed Solution

A unified, generic task model that:

- Eliminates artificial task/subtask distinction

- Supports unlimited nesting and hierarchical organization

- Provides template-based workflow instantiation

- Enables complex dependency management

- Offers flexible attribute system for extensibility

- Implements rich lifecycle management with event emission

#
# Core Design Principles

1. **Unified Task Model** - No separate subtask concept; all tasks can contain other tasks

2. **Composition Over Inheritance** - Tasks are composed of behaviors rather than inheriting from rigid classes

3. **Template-Based Instantiation** - Repeatable tasks are templates that can be instantiated

4. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Lifecycle changes trigger events for extensibility

5. **Flexible Attribute System** - Tasks can have custom attributes without schema changes

#
# Key Components Overview

#
## 1. Generic Task Structure

- **Unified Identity**: Single task class for all task types

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Parent-child relationships without artificial limits

- **Flexible Dependencies**: Multiple dependency types and chaining support

- **Dynamic Attributes**: Custom attributes without schema modifications

- **Rich Lifecycle**: Comprehensive state machine with event emission

#
## 2. Task Templates

- **Predefined Workflows**: Common task patterns as reusable templates

- **Parameterization**: Templates accept parameters for customization

- **Instantiation**: Templates create concrete task hierarchies

- **Examples**: GitHub workflows, deployment pipelines, review processes

#
## 3. Dependency System

- **Completion Dependencies**: Sequential task execution requirements

- **Data Dependencies**: Tasks requiring output from other tasks

- **Approval Dependencies**: Human or automated approval gates

- **Cross-Chain Dependencies**: Dependencies across different task chains

#
## 4. Prerequisites System

- **Pre-Completion Conditions**: Requirements before task can be marked complete

- **Automatic Validation**: System-checkable prerequisites

- **Manual Verification**: Human-verified prerequisites

- **Examples**: Version updates, test passage, approval receipt

#
## 5. Lifecycle Management

- **Rich State Machine**: Multiple stages from draft to superseded

- **Event Emission**: Notifications at each state transition

- **Automatic Detection**: System identifies superseded or redundant tasks

- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of state changes and reasons

#
# Module Organization

This specification is organized into focused modules:

- **[Core Components](core-components.md)** - Detailed component specifications and data models

- **[Technical Architecture](technical-architecture.md)** - Database schema and system architecture

- **[Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md)** - Phase-by-phase implementation strategy

- **[Template & Event Systems](template-event-systems.md)** - Template and event system details

- **[Performance & Operations](performance-operations.md)** - Performance optimization and operational considerations

#
# Key Benefits

- **Simplified Mental Model**: Single task concept instead of artificial dual model

- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Support for any workflow pattern through templates

- **Better Dependencies**: Rich dependency management with multiple types

- **Improved Extensibility**: Custom attributes and event-driven plugins

- **Performance Gains**: Optimized database schema and query patterns

- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Backward-compatible implementation strategy

#
# Success Metrics

- **API Simplification**: 50% reduction in MCP tool complexity

- **Performance Improvement**: 30% faster task operations

- **Template Adoption**: 80% of workflows use templates within 6 months

- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved ease of use scores

- **System Reliability**: Reduced bugs and edge cases

#
# Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed** - This feature has been successfully implemented and deployed. The unified task model is now the foundation of the MCP Task Orchestrator, providing the flexibility and extensibility envisioned in this specification.
