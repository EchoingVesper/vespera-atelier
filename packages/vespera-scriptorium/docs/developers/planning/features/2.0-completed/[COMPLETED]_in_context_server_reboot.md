# üîß Feature Specification: In-Context Server Reboot Mechanism

**Feature ID**: `IN_CONTEXT_REBOOT_001`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Category**: Core Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Created**: 2025-06-02  
**Status**: Proposed  

#

# üìã Overview

A graceful server restart mechanism that allows the MCP Task Orchestrator to reload without closing the host application (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.). This feature enables seamless updates, configuration changes, and error recovery without losing the working context or requiring manual client restart.

#

# üéØ Objectives

1. **Seamless Reload**: Restart the orchestrator server without closing the client application

2. **State Preservation**: Maintain task state and context across restarts

3. **Zero Client Impact**: Client connections automatically reconnect after server restart

4. **Quick Recovery**: Enable rapid recovery from errors or configuration changes

5. **Developer Experience**: Eliminate the need to restart entire development environment

#

# üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Implementation

#

#

# New Tools/Functions

```python

# New MCP tools

orchestrator_restart_server(
    graceful: bool = True,
    preserve_state: bool = True,
    timeout: int = 30
) -> RestartStatus

orchestrator_health_check() -> HealthStatus

orchestrator_shutdown_prepare() -> ShutdownReadiness

orchestrator_reconnect_test() -> ConnectionStatus

#

#

# Server Architecture Changes

1. **Graceful Shutdown Handler**: Clean task suspension and state serialization

2. **State Persistence Layer**: Save active tasks and context before shutdown

3. **Restart Coordinator**: Manage the shutdown/startup sequence

4. **Client Notification System**: Inform clients of impending restart

5. **Auto-Reconnection Protocol**: Handle client reconnection transparently

#

#

# Integration Points

1. **MCP Protocol**: Extend with restart notification messages

2. **Client Libraries**: Update to handle reconnection events

3. **Database Layer**: Ensure clean connection closure and reopening

4. **Task Lifecycle**: Integrate with task suspension/resumption

#

# üîÑ Implementation Approach

#

#

# Phase 1: Graceful Shutdown (1 day)

- Implement server state serialization

- Create task suspension mechanism

- Build database connection cleanup

- Develop shutdown readiness checks

#

#

# Phase 2: Restart Mechanism (1 day)

- Create subprocess management for server restart

- Implement restart command in MCP tools

- Build state restoration on startup

- Add restart reason tracking

#

#

# Phase 3: Client Reconnection (1 day)

- Implement reconnection protocol

- Add client notification system

- Create automatic retry logic

- Build connection state recovery

#

# üìä Benefits

#

#

# Immediate Benefits

- Apply schema migrations without closing development environment

- Reload configuration changes instantly

- Recover from errors without losing context

- Test server changes without restarting clients

#

#

# Long-term Benefits

- Enable hot-reloading for development

- Support zero-downtime updates

- Improve error recovery capabilities

- Foundation for high-availability features

#

# üîç Success Metrics

- **Restart Time**: <5 seconds for full restart cycle

- **State Recovery**: 100% of active tasks recovered after restart

- **Connection Success**: >99% automatic client reconnection rate

- **Context Preservation**: Zero loss of working context or unsaved data

#

# üéØ Migration Strategy

#

#

# Initial Implementation

1. Add restart capability to existing server

2. Update clients to handle disconnection gracefully

3. Implement basic state preservation

4. Test with various client applications

#

#

# Enhanced Features

1. Add hot-reload for configuration changes

2. Implement partial restart (specific components)

3. Create restart scheduling and automation

4. Build restart history and analytics

#

# üìù Additional Considerations

#

#

# Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk 1**: Data loss during restart - Mitigation: Comprehensive state serialization, transaction management

- **Risk 2**: Client confusion during restart - Mitigation: Clear status indicators, predictable behavior

- **Risk 3**: Restart loops on error - Mitigation: Restart attempt limits, fallback mechanisms

#

#

# Dependencies

- MCP protocol extension capabilities

- Client library update coordination

- Process management libraries (psutil or similar)

- State serialization framework

#

#

# Special Considerations for Different Clients

- **Claude Desktop**: May need special handling for Electron IPC

- **VSCode/Cursor**: Integrate with extension restart capabilities

- **Windsurf**: Ensure compatibility with custom client features

---

**Next Steps**: 

1. Review and approve specification

2. Design MCP protocol extensions for restart

3. Create proof-of-concept implementation

4. Test with each supported client type
