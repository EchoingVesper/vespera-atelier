# [COMPLETED] Temporary File Staging System

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Implementation Date**: June 1, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH (Addresses Context Limit Issues)  
**Category**: Core Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Actual Effort**: ~3 hours  

#

# Summary

Implemented a comprehensive temporary file staging infrastructure that provides atomic file operations, interruption recovery, and cleanup mechanisms to handle context limit issues in Claude Desktop and enable robust file writing operations.

#

# Problem Statement

#

#

# Critical Issues Addressed

- **Context limit crashes**: Large content operations causing Claude Desktop crashes

- **Interrupted file operations**: Lost work when operations are interrupted

- **No atomic file operations**: Risk of corrupted files during write operations

- **Resource cleanup**: No mechanism for cleaning up temporary files

- **Large content handling**: Inability to handle content exceeding context limits

#

#

# Business Impact

- **User Experience**: Prevents data loss and improves reliability

- **System Reliability**: Enables atomic file operations with rollback capability

- **Development Efficiency**: Reduces time lost to interrupted operations

- **Scalability**: Enables handling of large content without context overflow

# Operation Lifecycle

1. **PENDING**: Operation created, ready for content

2. **IN_PROGRESS**: Content being written to staging area

3. **COMPLETED**: Successfully committed to target location

4. **FAILED**: Operation failed with error message

5. **CANCELLED**: Operation cancelled by user

6. **CLEANING_UP**: Temporary files being removed

#

#

# Integration Points

#

#

#

# MCP Tool Enhancement

- Replace direct file writes with staged operations

- Integrate with existing `write_file` and similar tools

- Provide progress tracking for long operations

#

#

#

# Task Orchestrator Integration

- Enhanced artifact management with staging support

- Large content handling without context overflow

- Session continuity across context resets

#

# Usage Examples

#

#

# Basic Atomic File Writing

```text
python

# Simple atomic file write

success = await write_file_atomically(
    file_path="/path/to/file.txt",
    content="Large content that might be interrupted..."
)

```text

#

#

# Streaming Large Content

```text
python

# Streaming with interruption recovery

config = WriteConfig(
    chunking_strategy=ChunkingStrategy.ADAPTIVE,
    backup_original=True
)

async with StreamingFileWriter("/path/to/large_file.txt", config) as writer:
    for chunk in large_content_chunks:
        await writer.write(chunk)

# Auto-committed on context exit

```text

#

#

# Batch Operations

```python

# Atomic batch operations

files = {
    "/path/to/file1.txt": "Content 1",
    "/path/to/file2.txt": "Content 2", 
    "/path/to/file3.txt": "Content 3"
}

success = await write_files_batch(files)

# True only if ALL files written successfully

```text

#

# Configuration

#

#

# WriteConfig Options

- **chunk_size**: Configurable chunk size (default 8KB)

- **chunking_strategy**: Content chunking approach

- **validate_integrity**: Checksum validation on commit

- **auto_commit**: Automatic operation completion

- **backup_original**: Original file backup before overwrite

- **max_retries**: Retry count for failed operations

- **retry_delay**: Exponential backoff delay configuration

#

#

# StagingManager Configuration
