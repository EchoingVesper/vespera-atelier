# ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

The MCP Task Orchestrator v2.0 represents a fundamental transformation from a task-focused system to a comprehensive session-aware project management platform. This roadmap outlines 16 total features across 4 major categories, with estimated implementation effort of 20-24 weeks.

#
# Key Transformation Areas

1. **Session Management Foundation** (4 features) - Core architectural enhancement

2. **Existing Approved Features** (6 features) - Ready for implementation  

3. **System Infrastructure** (4 features) - Supporting capabilities

4. **Optional Extensions** (2 features) - Enhanced functionality

#
# Roadmap Organization

This comprehensive roadmap is organized into focused modules for detailed planning and execution:

#
## Foundation Module

- **[Session Management Foundation](session-management-foundation.md)** - Core v2.0 architectural features
  - Enhanced Session Management Architecture
  - Bi-directional Persistence System
  - Mode/Role System Enhancement
  - Generic Task Model Design

#
## Implementation Modules

- **[Approved Features Catalog](approved-features-catalog.md)** - Ready-to-implement v2.0 features
  - Orchestrator Intelligence Suite Bundle
  - Smart Task Routing
  - Template Pattern Library
  - Testing Automation Quality Suite
  - Git Integration Issue Management
  - Documentation Automation Intelligence

- **[Infrastructure Features](infrastructure-features.md)** - Supporting system capabilities
  - Integration Health Monitoring
  - Automation Maintenance Enhancement
  - In-Context Server Reboot
  - Enhanced Features Index with Status Tracking

#
## Planning Modules

- **[Implementation Timeline](implementation-timeline.md)** - Detailed scheduling and dependencies

- **[Resource Allocation](resource-allocation.md)** - Effort estimation and team planning

#
# Strategic Vision

#
## Core Transformation

The v2.0 roadmap fundamentally transforms the MCP Task Orchestrator from:

**From**: Task-centric tool with basic orchestration

- Single session workflow

- Static role configuration

- Basic task management

- Limited context awareness

**To**: Session-aware project management platform

- Multi-session workspace management

- Dynamic role and mode configuration

- Intelligent task routing and execution

- Comprehensive context preservation

- Advanced automation and monitoring

#
## Success Metrics

- **Implementation Completeness**: 100% of planned features delivered

- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with enhanced features

- **User Adoption**: 80% of users utilizing session management

- **Performance**: <5% overhead for enhanced capabilities

- **Developer Experience**: 50% reduction in configuration complexity

#
# Implementation Approach

#
## Phase-Based Delivery

1. **Foundation Phase** (Weeks 1-8): Core session management and architecture

2. **Feature Phase** (Weeks 9-16): Approved v2.0 features implementation

3. **Infrastructure Phase** (Weeks 17-20): Supporting systems and monitoring

4. **Optimization Phase** (Weeks 21-24): Performance tuning and polish

#
## Risk Management

- **Technical Risk**: Modular architecture reduces integration complexity

- **Timeline Risk**: Prioritized features ensure core value delivery

- **Quality Risk**: Comprehensive testing strategy throughout implementation

- **Adoption Risk**: Backward compatibility and gradual migration paths

#
# Key Dependencies

#
## Critical Path

1. Enhanced Session Management Architecture (foundation for all features)

2. Generic Task Model Design (enables advanced task management)

3. Bi-directional Persistence System (supports session continuity)

4. Mode/Role System Enhancement (enables customization)

#
## External Dependencies

- Claude Code compatibility requirements

- MCP protocol stability

- Database migration capabilities

- File system monitoring libraries

#
# Quality Assurance

#
## Validation Requirements

- Comprehensive unit test coverage (>90%)

- Integration testing for all feature combinations

- Performance benchmarking against v1.x baseline

- User acceptance testing with real-world scenarios

#
## Documentation Standards

- Feature specifications with clear acceptance criteria

- API documentation with examples

- Migration guides for existing users

- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

This master roadmap provides the strategic framework for transforming the MCP Task Orchestrator into a next-generation project management platform while maintaining reliability and ease of use.
