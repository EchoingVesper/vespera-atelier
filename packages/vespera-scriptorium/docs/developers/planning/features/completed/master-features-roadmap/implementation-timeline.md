#
## Bottleneck Management

**Database Schema (Critical Bottleneck)**

- Must complete before Mode System and MCP Tools

- Parallel development of documentation to minimize impact

- Comprehensive testing required due to data migration

**Session Management (Foundation Bottleneck)**

- Blocks all other feature development

- Highest priority for resource allocation

- Early validation and testing critical

**Automation Enhancement (Integration Bottleneck)**

- Longest development time (6 weeks)

- Required for Smart Task Routing and Template Library

- Consider breaking into smaller deliverable chunks
