**Document Type**: Integration Strategy  
**Created**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: Planning  
**Scope**: Dual-Purpose Architecture

#

# Overview

The MCP Task Orchestrator is designed as both a standalone MCP server and the core orchestration engine for Vespera Atelier, a comprehensive creative assistant suite. This dual-purpose architecture enables broader adoption while supporting specialized creative workflows.

#

# Vespera Atelier Monorepo Context

**Location**: `/mnt/e/dev/monorepo/vespera-atelier/`  
**Status**: Active development, no GitHub repository yet  
**Purpose**: Creative assistant suite to accelerate creative processes

#

#

# Current Vespera Atelier Components

- **Obsidian Plugin**: Document processing and chunking (JS/TS)
  - File chunking tools for large document processing
  - Local LLM integration for content analysis
  - A2A framework prototypes (agent-to-agent communication)
  - Document organization and information extraction

- **Core Infrastructure**: Shared tools and frameworks

- **Creative Workflow Tools**: Specialized tools for creative processes

#

# Dual-Purpose Architecture Benefits
