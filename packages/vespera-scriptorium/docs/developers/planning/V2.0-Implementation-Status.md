# Technical Debt Eliminated

#

#

# ✅ Root Directory Cleanup Completed

- **Removed**: 6 duplicate directories (orchestrator/, reboot/, staging/, monitoring/, db/, config/)

- **Removed**: 8 legacy Python files at root level

- **Removed**: Accidental files (=0.19.0, empty directories)

- **Archived**: All legacy code preserved in `docs/archives/legacy-code/`

#

#

# ✅ Import Path Fixes

- Fixed broken imports in reboot module

- Verified clean architecture works end-to-end

- No broken dependencies or circular imports

#

# Ready for Release Activities

#

#

# Immediate Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Run full test suite validation

2. **Performance Testing** - Validate Generic Task Model performance

3. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end MCP tool workflows

4. **Documentation Review** - Final documentation pass

5. **Release Preparation** - Version bumping and release notes

#
