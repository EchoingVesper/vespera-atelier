# Organization Impact

#

#

# Documentation Structure Transformation

```text

BEFORE (Chaotic):                    AFTER (Organized):
docs/prompts/ (60+ files)    →      docs/planning/ (strategic planning)
docs/ (20+ loose files)      →      docs/user-guide/ docs/reference/ docs/development/
planning/ (scattered)        →      docs/planning/ (consolidated)
architecture/ (scattered)    →      docs/architecture/ (focused)

```text

#

#

# Root Directory Transformation  

```text

BEFORE (Cluttered):                  AFTER (Clean):
25+ root files                →      <15 essential files
Duplicate directories         →      Single source of truth
Legacy code mixed in          →      Clean package structure
Test files scattered          →      Organized in tests/
