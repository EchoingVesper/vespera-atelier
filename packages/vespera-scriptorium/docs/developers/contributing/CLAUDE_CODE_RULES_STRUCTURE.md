# Claude Code Rules Structure Documentation

#

# Overview

The MCP Task Orchestrator project implements a comprehensive **Claude Code Rules Structure** that provides context-aware guidance for development work across different project areas. This system enables specialized development workflows through directory-specific guidance files.

#

# Architecture

#

#

# Core Components

**Main CLAUDE.md** (`/CLAUDE.md`)

- Universal project guidance and overview

- High-level commands and project structure

- Git workflow and repository management guidelines

- Integration with orchestrator tools and enhanced features

**Directory-Specific CLAUDE.md Files**

- Specialized guidance for specific development contexts

- Area-specific commands and best practices

- Integration patterns for each project domain

- Context-aware development workflows

# Usage Patterns

#

#

# Universal Context (`cd project_root && claude`)

Access comprehensive project guidance:

- Project overview and version information

- System diagnostic commands

- Git workflow and repository management

- Enhanced testing and development server commands

- Architecture overview and troubleshooting

#

#

# Specialized Context (`cd <directory> && claude`)

Access area-specific guidance:

- **Documentation**: `cd docs && claude` for multi-audience documentation workflows

- **Testing**: `cd tests && claude` for enhanced testing procedures

- **Scripts**: `cd scripts && claude` for diagnostic and maintenance tools

- **Core**: `cd mcp_task_orchestrator && claude` for orchestrator development

- **Architecture**: `cd architecture && claude` for design documentation

#

# Directory-Specific Features

#

#

# Documentation Directory (`docs/CLAUDE.md`)

**Focus**: Multi-audience documentation development

- Documentation architecture guidance (user-guide, llm-agents, architecture areas)

- Content validation commands and testing procedures

- Writing guidelines for different audience types (human vs LLM-optimized)

- Feature documentation workflow patterns

- Quality standards and cross-reference management

**Key Commands**:

```text
bash

# Documentation status

cat INDEX.md

# Test documentation completeness

python ../tests/test_example_file_creation.py

# Validate cross-references

grep -r "docs/" . --include="*.md"

```text
text

#

#

# Testing Directory (`tests/CLAUDE.md`)

**Focus**: Enhanced testing infrastructure

- Enhanced test runners (alternative to pytest)

python test_resource_cleanup.py

# Hang detection testing

python test_hang_detection.py

```text
text

#

#

# Scripts Directory (`scripts/CLAUDE.md`)

**Focus**: System utilities and diagnostics

- Diagnostic command reference (health checks, verification, database analysis)

- Performance and troubleshooting utilities

- Installation and setup scripts

- Script development patterns and safety guidelines

- Maintenance coordination integration

**Key Commands**:

```text
bash

# System health checking

python diagnostics/check_status.py
python diagnostics/verify_tools.py
python diagnostics/diagnose_db.py

```text
text

#

#

# Core Implementation Directory (`mcp_task_orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`)

**Focus**: Core orchestration engine development

- MCP server implementation patterns

- Async safety guidelines and database operations

- SQLAlchemy ORM usage patterns

- Orchestration logic and specialist assignment

- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Key Commands**:

```text
bash

# Run the MCP server

python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.server

# Database connectivity testing

python -c "from db.persistence import get_db_connection; get_db_connection()"

```text
text

#

#

# Architecture Directory (`architecture/CLAUDE.md`)

**Focus**: Design decisions and technical records

- Architecture documentation patterns

- Decision record structure and guidelines

- Design analysis commands

- System integration documentation

- Component relationship analysis

**Key Commands**:

```text
bash

# Review current architecture

find . -name "*.md" -exec echo "=== {} ===" \; -exec head -10 {} \;

# Check decision records

grep -r "Decision:" . --include="*.md"

```text

# Development Workflow Integration

#

#

# Context-Aware Development

The Claude Code Rules Structure enables context-aware development by providing specialized guidance based on the current working directory:

1. **Universal Context**: Start with main CLAUDE.md for project overview

2. **Specialized Context**: Navigate to specific directories for focused work

3. **Cross-Reference**: Files reference each other and main documentation

4. **Tool Integration**: Commands optimized for each directory's specific needs

#

#

# Orchestrator Integration

All directory-specific files integrate with the MCP Task Orchestrator system:

- **Specialist Assignment**: Each directory aligns with specific orchestrator specialists

- **Artifact Storage**: Compatible with the artifact storage system for complex work

- **Maintenance Coordination**: Integrates with maintenance coordinator tools

- **Enhanced Testing**: Leverages the project's enhanced testing infrastructure

#

# Maintenance Procedures

#

#

# File Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Update directory-specific files when project structure changes

- **Command Validation**: Verify all commands work correctly in their respective directories

- **Cross-Reference Checking**: Ensure links and references remain accurate

- **Consistency Maintenance**: Keep formatting and structure consistent across files

#

#

# Content Validation Process

```text
bash

# Test all directory-specific commands

cd docs && python ../tests/test_example_file_creation.py
cd tests && python simple_test_runner.py
cd scripts && python diagnostics/check_status.py
cd mcp_task_orchestrator && python -m mcp_task_orchestrator.server --test
cd architecture && find . -name "*.md" -exec head -5 {} \;
```text

#

#

# Quality Assurance

- **Accuracy**: All commands and examples must be tested and working

- **Completeness**: Coverage of all major development patterns and use cases

- **Clarity**: Concepts clearly explained with practical examples

- **Consistency**: Consistent style and terminology across all files

#

# Best Practices

#

#

# Usage Recommendations

1. **Start Universal**: Begin with main CLAUDE.md for project context

2. **Navigate Specifically**: Use `cd <directory> && claude` for focused work

3. **Reference Cross-Files**: Leverage cross-references between files

4. **Validate Commands**: Test commands before relying on them in workflows

#

#

# Development Guidelines

- **Context-Specific Work**: Use appropriate directory for the type of work

- **Tool Integration**: Leverage directory-specific command optimizations

- **Orchestrator Usage**: Use orchestrator specialists aligned with directory focus

- **Documentation Maintenance**: Update files when making structural changes

#

#

# Integration Patterns

- **Multi-Directory Projects**: Use orchestrator for work spanning multiple areas

- **Specialist Assignment**: Align work with appropriate directory and specialist

- **Artifact Storage**: Leverage artifact system for complex, multi-context work

- **Enhanced Testing**: Use enhanced testing infrastructure for validation

#

# Troubleshooting

#

#

# Common Issues

- **Command Failures**: Verify working directory and path contexts

- **Missing Context**: Ensure you're in the correct directory for specialized guidance

- **Outdated Information**: Check file modification dates and update as needed

- **Cross-Reference Errors**: Validate links when project structure changes

#

#

# Resolution Steps

1. **Verify Context**: Confirm current working directory

2. **Check Updates**: Ensure files are current with project changes

3. **Test Commands**: Validate commands in clean environment

4. **Cross-Reference**: Check related files for consistency

---

**Maintenance**: This structure requires regular maintenance to stay current with project evolution. Update files when making structural changes to the project.
