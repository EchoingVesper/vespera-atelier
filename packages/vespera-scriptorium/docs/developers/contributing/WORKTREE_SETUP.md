# Git Worktrees Setup Complete

#

# 🎯 **Setup Summary**

✅ **Git worktrees configured for parallel Claude Code development**  
✅ **Two critical infrastructure worktrees created**  
✅ **CLAUDE.md files updated with worktree-specific guidance**  
✅ **Development environment setup script created**

#

# 📁 **Available Worktrees**

#

#

# 1. Database Migration System

- **Path**: `worktrees/db-migration/`

- **Branch**: `feature/automatic-database-migration`

- **Task ID**: `task_0b13127d`

- **Focus**: Automatic schema migration system with rollback capability

#

#

# 2. In-Context Server Reboot  

- **Path**: `worktrees/server-reboot/`

- **Branch**: `feature/in-context-server-reboot`

- **Task ID**: `task_2f047d36`

- **Focus**: Hot reload mechanism preserving MCP client connections

#

# 🚀 **How to Use Worktrees**

#

#

# **Start Development in a Worktree**

```bash

# Option 1: Quick setup and launch

cd worktrees/db-migration && claude

# Option 2: Use setup script first

./scripts/setup_worktree.sh db-migration
cd worktrees/db-migration && claude

# Option 3: Manual navigation

git worktree list
cd worktrees/server-reboot && claude

```text

#

#

# **Parallel Development Workflow**

**Terminal 1** (Database Migration):

```text
bash
cd worktrees/db-migration
claude

# Execute: architect_f74a18 (Design migration detection engine)

```text
text

**Terminal 2** (Server Reboot):

```bash
cd worktrees/server-reboot  
claude

# Execute: architect_9e06a9 (Design state serialization)

```text

#

#

# **Development Environment Setup**

Each worktree includes:

- ✅ **Isolated file state** - Changes don't affect other worktrees

- ✅ **Shared Git history** - All worktrees share same repository history

- ✅ **Worktree-specific CLAUDE.md** - Focused guidance for each feature

- ✅ **Task orchestrator integration** - Direct access to assigned subtasks

#

# 📋 **Ready-to-Execute Tasks**

#

#

# **Database Migration System** (`task_0b13127d`)

1. **architect_f74a18**: Design migration detection engine (8 hours)

2. **implementer_8cf1b2**: Implement migration execution/safety (6 hours)

3. **implementer_ade9c3**: Server startup integration (4 hours)  

4. **tester_2e6081**: Testing and validation suite (6 hours)

5. **documenter_e868b9**: Documentation and procedures (3 hours)

#

#

# **Server Reboot Mechanism** (`task_2f047d36`)

1. **architect_9e06a9**: Design state serialization/shutdown (6 hours)

2. **implementer_a8b5f3**: Graceful shutdown implementation (8 hours)

3. **implementer_dd2297**: Restart mechanism (8 hours)

4. **implementer_9d9414**: Reboot coordination (4 hours)

5. **tester_953f91**: Reboot testing/validation (6 hours)

6. **documenter_b80ca2**: Documentation (3 hours)

#

# 🔧 **Worktree Management Commands**

```text
bash

# List all worktrees

git worktree list

# Create new worktree for additional features

git worktree add worktrees/feature-name -b feature/feature-name

# Remove completed worktree

git worktree remove worktrees/feature-name

# Check worktree status

./scripts/setup_worktree.sh <worktree_name>
```text

#

# 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Start Parallel Development**: Open two Claude Code instances in different worktrees

2. **Execute Architect Tasks**: Both `architect_f74a18` and `architect_9e06a9` can run in parallel

3. **Coordinate Implementation**: Use shared task orchestrator to track progress

4. **Merge Completed Features**: Each worktree creates independent branches for merging

#

# 💡 **Benefits Achieved**

- **🚀 Parallel Development**: Work on both critical features simultaneously

- **🔒 Complete Isolation**: No interference between development streams  

- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Orchestrator tracks tasks across all worktrees

- **🔄 Easy Context Switching**: Switch between features without losing state

- **🛡️ Risk Mitigation**: Isolated environments prevent cross-feature conflicts

**Ready for immediate parallel development of critical infrastructure components!**
