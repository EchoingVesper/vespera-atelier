#

# 🔧 Technical Architecture Implemented

#

#

# File Operation Tracking

```python

# Track file operations with comprehensive metadata

operation_id = await tracker.track_file_operation(
    FileOperationType.CREATE, 
    file_path, 
    content_hash=hash, 
    metadata={"purpose": "documentation"}
)

```text

#

#

# File Verification Engine

```text
python

# Verify operations actually persisted to disk

verification = await engine.verify_file_operation(operation)

# Returns detailed verification with file existence, content matching, size verification

```text

#

#

# Context Recovery System

```python

# Generate comprehensive recovery information

recovery_info = await manager.generate_context_recovery_summary(subtask_id)

# Provides complete context for session continuity

```text

#

# 🚀 Integration Ready Features

#

#

# Easy Orchestrator Integration

- **Simple API**: Create tracker with `create_subtask_tracker(subtask_id)`

- **Automatic Verification**: Call `verify_all_operations()` before task completion

- **Context Recovery**: Access `get_context_recovery_info()` for session transitions

- **Migration Support**: Run `migrate_file_tracking_tables()` for database updates

#

#

# Database Schema Ready

- **New Tables**: `file_operations`, `file_verifications`

- **Enhanced Tables**: `subtasks` with `file_operations_count` and `verification_status`

- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys linking operations to subtasks

- **Indexing**: Optimized for query performance

#

#

# Comprehensive Error Handling

- **Operation Failures**: Detailed error capture and reporting

- **Verification Failures**: Specific failure reasons and recommendations

- **Database Errors**: Transaction safety and rollback protection

- **File System Errors**: Graceful handling of permission and access issues

#

# 🧪 Testing Status

#

#

# Test Coverage Implemented
