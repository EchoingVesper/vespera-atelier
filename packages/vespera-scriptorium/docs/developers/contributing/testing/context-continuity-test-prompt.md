# Context Continuity System Test Prompt

**Purpose**: Test the context continuity system's ability to recover and continue work across session boundaries.

---

#

# ðŸ§ª Context Continuity Recovery Test

Hello! I need to test the **context continuity system** that was recently implemented for the MCP Task Orchestrator. This test will validate that work can be seamlessly recovered and continued across session boundaries.

#

#

# Test Scenario

I'm simulating a situation where:

1. Previous work was interrupted during task execution

2. This is a completely new session/context

3. I need to recover the full context of previous work

4. Continue execution with complete context awareness

#

#

# What to Test

#

#

#

# 1. Enhanced Orchestrator Initialization

Please initialize the enhanced orchestrator with context continuity and verify:

- Enhanced orchestrator loads successfully

- Context continuity system is operational

- File tracking and decision documentation are available

- Session continuity features are enabled

#

#

#

# 2. Context Recovery Capabilities

Test context recovery for existing tasks:

- Recover context for any existing subtask (if available)

- Generate context recovery packages

- Validate that file operations history is preserved

- Confirm architectural decisions are accessible

#

#

#

# 3. Work Stream Readiness

Verify that work streams are ready for enhanced execution:

- Check documentation work stream readiness with context protection

- Verify testing work stream readiness with verification integration

- Confirm enhanced completion workflows are available

#

#

#

# 4. Integration Validation

Validate the integration between systems:

- File tracking integration with orchestrator

- Decision documentation integration

- Enhanced completion workflows

- Session continuity reporting

#

#

# Expected Demonstrations

#

#

#

# Enhanced Session Information

Show enhanced session initialization that includes:

```text

- Context continuity: enabled

- Session ID: [new session ID]

- Enhanced capabilities: [list of enhanced features]

- File tracking: operational

- Decision documentation: operational

```text

#

#

#

# Context Recovery Example

Demonstrate context recovery for a task:

```text
text

- Task context recovered: [true/false]

- Files affected: [list of files]

- Decisions made: [count and summary]

- Continuation guidance: [specific guidance for resuming work]

- Recovery recommendations: [actionable steps]

```text
text

#

#

#

# Work Stream Protection Status

Show work stream readiness:

```text

- Documentation work stream: ready with context protection

- Testing work stream: ready with verification integration

- Context protection enabled: true

- Recovery capabilities: available

```text
text

#

#

# Success Criteria

The test is successful if:

- âœ… Enhanced orchestrator initializes with context continuity

- âœ… Context recovery works for existing tasks (if any)

- âœ… Work streams show readiness with context protection

- âœ… File tracking and decision systems are operational

- âœ… Session continuity features are available

- âœ… Integration between all systems is seamless

#

#

# Test Commands to Execute

Please run these specific tests:

1. **Initialize Enhanced Orchestrator**
   

```text

   Initialize the enhanced orchestrator and show session information
   

```text
text
text

2. **Check Context Continuity Status**
   

```text
text

   Get session continuity status and capabilities
   

```text
text
text

3. **Verify Work Stream Readiness**
   

```text
text

   Check that documentation and testing work streams are ready with context protection
   

```text
text
text

4. **Test Context Recovery** (if tasks exist)
   

```text
text

   Attempt to recover context for any existing task
   
```text
text
text

5. **Validate Integration**
   ```

   Confirm all systems are integrated and operational
   ```

#

#

# What This Test Validates

This test validates the **critical infrastructure** that was implemented:

- **File Persistence Verification**: All file operations tracked and verified

- **Context Continuity Enhancement**: Decisions and context preserved across sessions

- **Integration with Work Streams**: Enhanced orchestrator ready for protected execution

#

#

# Expected Outcome

If the context continuity system is working correctly, this completely new session should be able to:

- Access the enhanced orchestrator with all context continuity features

- Recover complete context from any previous work

- Show that work streams are protected and ready for execution

- Demonstrate that no work or decisions have been lost

- Provide guidance for continuing any interrupted work

**Please proceed with testing the context continuity system!**

---

*This prompt tests the core promise of the context continuity system: that work can be seamlessly recovered and continued across any session boundary, ensuring no context or decisions are ever lost.*
