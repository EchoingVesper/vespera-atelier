# 🎯 Test Objective

Validate task orchestrator functionality while performing comprehensive directory cleanup and reorganization of the MCP Task Orchestrator project.

#

#

# ✅ Major Successes

**Task Orchestration:**

- ✅ 10 subtasks completed successfully

- ✅ Complex workflow with dependencies executed flawlessly  

- ✅ Specialist role assignment and context switching working perfectly

- ✅ 47 files reorganized across 10+ directories without data loss

**Project Reorganization:**

- ✅ Professional directory structure created

- ✅ Tests organized into unit/integration/performance/fixtures

- ✅ Scripts organized into diagnostics/maintenance/migrations/deployment

- ✅ Documentation restructured into development/testing/troubleshooting

- ✅ Logs and data files properly organized

- ✅ Configuration files updated to reflect new structure

#

#

# ⚠️ Issues Identified

**Critical (Needs Fix):**

- ❌ StateManager missing `_get_parent_task_id` method

- ❌ Parent task progress tracking broken

**Resolved During Testing:**

- ✅ Path resolution issues in diagnostic scripts (FIXED)

- ✅ Unicode compatibility problems (RESOLVED with ASCII alternatives)

- ✅ Database table name mismatches (CORRECTED)
