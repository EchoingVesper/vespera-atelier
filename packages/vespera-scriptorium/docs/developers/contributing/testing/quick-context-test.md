ðŸ§ª **Context Continuity Quick Test**

I need to test the context continuity system for the MCP Task Orchestrator in this new session.

**Test requests:**

1. Initialize the enhanced orchestrator with context continuity

2. Show session continuity status and capabilities  

3. Verify work stream readiness with context protection

4. Demonstrate context recovery for any existing task

5. Confirm critical infrastructure is complete and operational

**Expected**: Enhanced orchestrator with file tracking, decision documentation, and session continuity working across session boundaries.

This validates the recently completed critical infrastructure that prevents context loss.
