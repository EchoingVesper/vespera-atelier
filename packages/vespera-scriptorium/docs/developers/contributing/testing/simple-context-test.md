# ðŸ§ª Context Continuity Test - New Session

Hello! I need to test the context continuity system for the MCP Task Orchestrator. This is a completely new session and I want to validate that the enhanced orchestrator with context continuity is working properly.

**Please test the following:**

#

#

# 1. Initialize Enhanced Orchestrator

Initialize the enhanced orchestrator and show me the session information. I expect to see:

- Context continuity enabled

- Enhanced capabilities listed  

- File tracking operational

- Decision documentation available

#

#

# 2. Check Session Continuity Status

Get the current session continuity status and confirm all systems are operational.

#

#

# 3. Verify Work Stream Readiness

Check if the documentation and testing work streams are ready for execution with context protection.

#

#

# 4. Test Context Recovery (if applicable)

If there are any existing tasks, try to recover context for one of them to demonstrate the recovery capabilities.

#

#

# 5. Validate Critical Infrastructure

Confirm that all three critical infrastructure components are complete and integrated:

- File Persistence Verification Implementation âœ…

- Context Continuity Enhancement âœ…  

- Integration with Existing Work Streams âœ…

**Expected Result**: The system should demonstrate complete context continuity capabilities, showing that work can be recovered and continued across session boundaries with no loss of context or decisions.

This test validates that the recently implemented context continuity infrastructure is working correctly in a fresh session context.
