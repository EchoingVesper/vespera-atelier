# Execute META-PRP with Orchestrator Multi-Agent Coordination

Execute comprehensive meta-PRPs using the task orchestrator's full orchestration capabilities to coordinate sub-agents
through systematic multi-phase workflows with git worktree isolation and executive dysfunction design principles.

## Meta-PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Template Reference

**CRITICAL**: This execution assumes the meta-PRP was created using `PRPs/templates/meta_prp_structure.md` template with
hierarchical structure and git worktree strategy.

## Immediate Orchestrator Session Activation

**MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - Execute in Order:**

```bash
# 1. Verify orchestrator connection and full functionality
claude mcp list | grep task-orchestrator || (echo "ORCHESTRATOR NOT CONNECTED - Fixing..." && claude mcp restart task-orchestrator)

# 2. Test critical orchestrator tools for meta-coordination
# orchestrator_health_check must be available and functioning
```

**CRITICAL**: If orchestrator fails, STOP and follow CLAUDE.md protocol. Meta-PRPs require full orchestrator functionality.

**IMMEDIATE SESSION TAKEOVER:**

```yaml
# 3. Initialize orchestrator session for meta-PRP execution coordination
orchestrator_initialize_session:
  working_directory: "/current/project/path"
  session_name: "meta-prp-execution-{concept}-{timestamp}"
  
# 4. Orchestrator becomes the primary coordinator for all sub-agent spawning
orchestrator_role: "primary_execution_coordinator"
coordination_mode: "multi_agent_meta_prp_execution"
```

## Enhanced Context Loading

**MANDATORY**: Load and understand all context before execution:

```yaml
required_context_loading:
  - file: $ARGUMENTS  # The meta-PRP file to execute
    why: "Complete meta-PRP specification with orchestrator integration"
    sections: ["ALL - complete understanding required"]

  - file: PRPs/v2.0-release-meta-prp/meta-coordination-orchestrator.md
    why: "Reference implementation patterns for meta-coordination"
    sections: ["Orchestrator Tools Integration", "Workflow Patterns", "Testing Matrix"]

  - file: PRPs/ai_docs/context-engineering-guide.md
    why: "Multi-agent context engineering principles"
    sections: ["Multi-Agent Coordination", "Context Sharing Patterns"]

  - file: PRPs/ai_docs/systematic-testing-framework.md

      task_id: "[research_task_id]"
      
    sub_agent_instructions: |
      You are a RESEARCH SPECIALIST executing orchestrator task: [research_task_id]
      
      CRITICAL WORKTREE INTEGRATION:
      - Working in ISOLATED WORKTREE: ../worktrees/agent-research  
      - Branch: feature/research-phase (isolated from other agents)
      - Auto-preservation: Run "git add -A && git commit -m 'WIP: $(date)'" every 30 min
      - No merge conflicts: Your work is completely isolated
      
      CRITICAL ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION: 
      - FIRST: Use orchestrator_execute_task to get your specialist context and instructions
      - Work ONLY on the specific task assigned to you by the orchestrator
      - Use orchestrator_complete_task when finished - ALL work goes into artifacts
      - Reference meta-PRP file for complete context: $ARGUMENTS
      - Load relevant PRPs/ai_docs/ for specialized context
      - The orchestrator is your coordination backbone - maintain session throughout
      
      EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION SUPPORT:
      - Pre-created directory structure in PRPs/templates/meta_prp_structure.md eliminates decisions
      - Isolated worktree prevents overwhelm from other agent activities
      - Progress automatically preserved via git commits
      - Clear single focus area reduces cognitive load
      
      LESSONS LEARNED INTEGRATION:
      - Apply hook-style automated validation to your work
      - Consider what automated checks would prevent problems in your domain
      - Design your work to be artifact-centric, not summary-centric
      - All deliverables stored in orchestrator for future 'undo' capabilities
      
      Your task: Execute the research phase as specified in the meta-PRP

      action: orchestrator_execute_task
      task_id: "[architecture_task_id]"
      
    sub_agent_instructions: |
      You are an ARCHITECTURE SPECIALIST working on task: [architecture_task_id]
      
      CRITICAL:
      - Use orchestrator_execute_task to get your specialist context
      - Work ONLY on the specific task assigned to you
      - Use orchestrator_complete_task when finished with detailed artifacts
      - Reference meta-PRP file for complete context: $ARGUMENTS
      - Wait for research task completion (dependency management)
      
      Your task: Execute the architecture phase as specified in the meta-PRP
      Expected deliverable: Complete architecture artifacts stored via orchestrator_complete_task

  # Pattern continues for implementation_agent, testing_agent, security_agent...

## Completion Protocol

**After Meta-PRP Execution:**

1. **Verify all sub-agents completed** their assigned tasks
2. **Validate artifact storage** via orchestrator_complete_task
3. **Run synthesis validation** on orchestrator_synthesize_results
4. **Execute maintenance cleanup** via orchestrator_maintenance_coordinator
5. **COMMIT CHANGES**: Always commit completed meta-PRP execution results
6. **Context Engineering Score Target**: 10/10 (multi-agent coordination)
7. **Security Integration Score Target**: 10/10 (dedicated security validation)
8. **Orchestrator Integration Score Target**: 10/10 (full tool suite utilized)
9. **Multi-Agent Coordination Score Target**: 10/10 (seamless collaboration)
10. **Lessons Learned Integration Score Target**: 10/10 (hook patterns, session management, artifact-centric)
11. **Future 'Undo' Readiness Score Target**: 10/10 (all work stored in orchestrator for automation)

**Mad Scientist Achievement Unlocked**: *"Eventually I WILL have my automated 'oops! undo that!' feature!"*
- All work stored in orchestrator artifacts enables future automated undo capabilities
- Session management prevents infinite accumulation discovered in lessons learned  
- Hook patterns provide the automated problem detection foundation
- Agent-to-agent architecture will complete the automation vision

## No Manual Summary Required

**CRITICAL**: Meta-PRP execution does NOT require manual result summaries. The orchestrator's
`orchestrator_synthesize_results` and `orchestrator_complete_task` tools automatically handle:

- **Artifact aggregation** from all sub-agents
- **Result synthesis** into cohesive deliverables  
- **Detailed work storage** with proper categorization
- **Progress tracking** and completion status

**Return only**: Reference to the orchestrator task artifacts for the main agent to read.

Remember: Meta-PRP execution with orchestrator multi-agent coordination enables systematic execution of complex, multi-
phase projects with professional quality, comprehensive validation, and seamless collaboration between specialized sub-
agents working in orchestrated harmony.
