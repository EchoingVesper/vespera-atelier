## PR Title (if provided)

$ARGUMENTS

## Pre-Execution Orchestrator Check

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**
```bash
# Verify orchestrator connection and health
claude mcp list | grep task-orchestrator || (echo "ORCHESTRATOR NOT CONNECTED - Fixing..." && claude mcp restart task-orchestrator)

# Check orchestrator health before proceeding
# Use orchestrator_health_check if available
```

If orchestrator fails, STOP and spawn fix agent per CLAUDE.md protocol.

## Enhanced Context References

**Load and reference project-specific documentation:**

```yaml
required_context:
  - file: CLAUDE.md
    why: "Project-specific git workflow and commit requirements"
    sections: ["Commands", "Critical Directives"]

  - file: PRPs/ai_docs/cc_github_actions.md
    why: "GitHub integration patterns and workflows"
    sections: ["PR Best Practices", "CI Integration"]

  - file: PRPs/ai_docs/security-patterns.md
    why: "Security considerations for code changes"
    sections: ["Secure Development", "Code Review Security"]
```

## Security Considerations

Before creating PR, ensure:
- **No secrets or keys** committed to repository
- **Security-sensitive changes** properly reviewed
- **Input validation** for any new endpoints
- **Dependencies** security-scanned if updated
- **Error handling** doesn't leak sensitive information

## Process

1. **Prepare Branch**

   ```bash
   # Check current branch
   git branch --show-current
   
   # Ensure we're not on main
   # If on main, create a feature branch
   ```

2. **Review Changes**

   ```bash
   # See what will be included
   git status
   git diff main...HEAD
   ```

3. **Enhanced Code Quality & Security Validation**

   ```bash
   # Project-specific code formatting and linting
   black mcp_task_orchestrator/
   isort mcp_task_orchestrator/
   
   # Security scanning
   bandit -r mcp_task_orchestrator/ || echo "Security issues found - review required"
   safety check || echo "Dependency security issues found - review required"
   
   # Run project tests
   pytest -v
   
   # Type checking if configured
   mypy mcp_task_orchestrator/ || echo "Type checking not configured or failed"
   ```

4. **Create Commits with Enhanced Messages**
   - Stage relevant files with security review
   - Create logical, atomic commits if not already done
   - **CRITICAL**: Follow CLAUDE.md commit requirements
   - Write clear commit messages following conventional commits:
     - `feat:` for new features
     - `fix:` for bug fixes  
     - `docs:` for documentation
     - `test:` for tests
     - `refactor:` for refactoring
     - Include orchestrator task ID if applicable

5. **Push to Remote**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

6. **Create Enhanced PR**

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "$ARGUMENTS" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
