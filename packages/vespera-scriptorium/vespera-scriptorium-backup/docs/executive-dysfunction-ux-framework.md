# Executive Dysfunction-Aware User Experience Framework

**Purpose**: Comprehensive UX design framework for Vespera Scriptorium ensuring all interfaces support users across the full spectrum of cognitive capacity, with particular attention to executive dysfunction accessibility.

## Core UX Philosophy

### Universal Accessibility Through Executive Dysfunction Design

**Primary Principle**: Design for accessibility valleys - the times when users most need supportive tools - rather than peak performance states.

**Design Philosophy**: If it works well when you're exhausted, overwhelmed, or struggling with cognitive barriers, it will work excellently when you're at full capacity.

### The Pressure-Lid-Vent UX Model

Based on the extended pressure-lid metaphor, all UX decisions consider:

1. **Pressure Management**: How does this interface element affect available cognitive resources?
2. **Lid Weight Reduction**: What barriers to task initiation does this remove or add?
3. **Vent Prevention**: How does this prevent involuntary cognitive drain?
4. **Momentum Preservation**: How does this maintain progress across interruptions?

## UX Design Principles

### 1. Cognitive Load Optimization

#### Progressive Disclosure
```
Level 1: Essential information only (5-7 items max)
Level 2: Contextual details available on demand
Level 3: Advanced options hidden behind clear pathways
Level 4: Expert features accessible but not overwhelming
```

#### Information Hierarchy
- **Primary**: What the user needs right now
- **Secondary**: What they might need next
- **Tertiary**: What they could explore later
- **Quaternary**: Advanced or rare-use features

#### Decision Fatigue Prevention
- Intelligent defaults for 90% of use cases
- "Recommended" options clearly marked
- Ability to defer non-critical decisions
- Option to save decision patterns for reuse

### 2. Momentum Preservation Design

#### Seamless Context Recovery
```
Interruption → Automatic State Save → Context Markers → Recovery Assistance
```

**Implementation**:
- Auto-save every 30 seconds during active editing
- Context breadcrumbs showing "where you were"
- Visual momentum markers highlighting recent progress
- Quick resumption options with minimal cognitive load

#### Session Continuity
- Persistent workspace state across browser sessions
- Document position memory (scroll, cursor, selection)
- Recent activity timeline for context reconstruction
- Cross-device synchronization with conflict resolution

#### Progress Visualization
- Visual progress indicators that validate partial achievements
- Momentum tracking that shows accumulated work
- Achievement unlocks that recognize small wins
- Progress recovery tools for when work feels lost

### 3. Overwhelm Prevention Systems

#### Cognitive Capacity Adaptation
```
High Capacity    → Full feature set available
Medium Capacity  → Simplified interface with core features
Low Capacity     → Essential-only mode with rescue features
Crisis Mode     → Emergency simplification with support links
```

#### Escape Hatches and Safe Spaces
- Always-accessible "simplify interface" button
- One-click return to last known good state
- Emergency save and exit options
- Crisis mode with minimal cognitive demands

#### Attention Bandwidth Management
- Single-focus modes that hide distractions
- Customizable notification controls
- Quiet hours and focus time integration
- Sensory overload protection settings

### 4. Executive Function Support

#### Task Initiation Support
```
Intention → Template Selection → Guided Setup → Minimal Viable Start
```

**Features**:
- Smart templates that reduce blank page syndrome
- Guided workflows with clear next steps
- "Good enough to start" quality gates
- Momentum builders that create initial forward progress

#### Working Memory Augmentation
- External working memory through persistent sidebars
- Visual context preservation during task switching
- Inline reminders and context notes
- Cross-reference highlighting and linking

#### Flexible Structure Support
- Multiple ways to organize the same information
- Adaptable workflows that accommodate different thinking styles
- Non-linear navigation that supports associative thinking
- Structure that emerges from use rather than imposed upfront

## Interface Design Patterns

### 1. The Sanctuary Dashboard

**Purpose**: A cognitively safe home base that never overwhelms.

**Design Elements**:
- Clean, uncluttered primary workspace
- Gentle color palette optimized for extended viewing
- Predictable layout that builds spatial memory
- Customizable organization without overwhelming options

**Cognitive Benefits**:
- Reduces daily cognitive load of "where do I start?"
- Provides consistent mental anchor point
- Supports routine establishment
- Creates sense of control and familiarity

### 2. Context-Aware Sidebars

**Purpose**: Provide relevant information without context switching.

**Information Architecture**:
```
Primary Content (70% width)  |  Context Sidebar (30% width)
                             |
Document/Project Main Area   |  - Recently accessed
                             |  - Related documents  
                             |  - Quick actions
                             |  - Progress indicators
                             |  - Momentum markers
```

**Adaptive Behavior**:
- Auto-collapse when user needs focus
- Smart content suggestions based on current work
- One-click access to frequently needed tools
- Minimal cognitive load for context switching

### 3. Gentle Guidance Systems

**Purpose**: Provide direction without imposing rigid structure.

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Suggested next actions rather than required steps
- Multiple pathways to accomplish the same goal
- Gentle nudges toward helpful features
- Easy dismissal of guidance when not needed

**Examples**:
- "You might want to..." suggestions
- Contextual tips that appear based on behavior patterns
- Optional guided tours for new features
- Progressive skill building suggestions

### 4. Momentum Preservation Interfaces

**Purpose**: Maintain progress visibility and recovery options.

**Visual Elements**:
- Recent work timeline with quick resume options
- Progress visualization that shows accumulated effort
- Draft recovery interfaces for interrupted work
- Session state indicators showing "safe to close"

**Behavioral Support**:
- Automatic draft saving with clear recovery pathways
- Version history that doesn't penalize exploration
- Undo systems that work across sessions
- Progress markers that validate small achievements
