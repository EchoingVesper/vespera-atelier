# Core Components Specification

This document provides detailed specifications for the core components of the Generic Task Model.

#
# 1. Generic Task Structure

The `GenericTask` class serves as the unified foundation for all task types, eliminating the artificial distinction between tasks and subtasks.

```python
class GenericTask:
    
    
# Core Identity
    task_id: str
    task_type: str
    template_id: Optional[str]
    
    
# Hierarchical Structure
    parent_task_id: Optional[str]
    child_task_ids: List[str]
    
    
# Dependencies and Chaining
    depends_on: List[TaskDependency]
    chain_position: Optional[int]
    
    
# Flexible Attributes
    attributes: Dict[str, Any]
    
    
# Lifecycle Management
    status: TaskStatus
    lifecycle_stage: str
    superseded_by: Optional[str]
```text

#
## Core Identity Fields

**task_id**: Unique identifier for the task

- Format: UUID or custom format

- Immutable once created

- Used for all references and relationships

**task_type**: Categorizes the task for processing and display

- Examples: "feature", "bug", "deployment", "review"

- Determines available operations and lifecycle stages

- Used for filtering and specialized handling

**template_id**: Reference to the template used to create this task

- Optional field for template-instantiated tasks

- Enables template tracking and updates

- Supports template versioning and migration

#
## Hierarchical Structure

**parent_task_id**: Reference to parent task

- Creates tree structure without depth limits

- Null for root-level tasks

- Enables nested organization and rollup calculations

**child_task_ids**: List of child task references

- Maintains parent-child relationships

- Supports task decomposition and grouping

- Enables hierarchical operations (complete parent when all children complete)

#
## Dependencies and Chaining

**depends_on**: List of task dependencies

- Supports multiple dependency types

- Enables complex prerequisite requirements

- Allows for conditional dependencies

**chain_position**: Position in a task chain

- Optional field for sequential workflows

- Enables automatic progression through task sequences

- Supports parallel execution within chains

#
## Flexible Attributes

**attributes**: Dynamic key-value storage

- Allows custom fields without schema changes

- Supports JSON-serializable values

- Enables task type-specific data storage

- Examples: GitHub URLs, deployment targets, review criteria

#
## Lifecycle Management

**status**: Current task status

- Standard states: pending, active, blocked, completed, failed

- Supports custom statuses per task type

- Drives workflow and automation logic

**lifecycle_stage**: Detailed lifecycle position

- Granular stages: draft, ready, active, blocked, review, completed, archived, superseded

- Enables fine-grained workflow control

- Supports stage-specific validations and actions

**superseded_by**: Reference to superseding task

- Tracks when tasks are replaced or made obsolete

- Enables cleanup and archival logic

- Supports task evolution and replacement patterns

#
# 2. Task Templates

Templates provide reusable task structures for common workflows, enabling consistent and efficient task creation.

#
## Template Characteristics

- **Predefined Structure**: Common task hierarchies and dependencies

- **Parameterizable**: Accept variables for customization during instantiation

- **Versioned**: Support template evolution and backward compatibility

- **Composable**: Templates can include other templates

#
## Template Examples

**Feature Development Template**:

- Research and design tasks

- Implementation task hierarchy

- Testing and validation tasks

- Review and approval tasks

- Deployment tasks

**Deployment Pipeline Template**:

- Build and packaging tasks

- Environment preparation tasks

- Deployment execution tasks

- Validation and rollback tasks

**Code Review Template**:

- Automated checks (linting, tests)

- Peer review tasks

- Approval workflow tasks

- Merge and integration tasks

#
## Template Instantiation

Templates create concrete task hierarchies with:

- Parameter substitution for customization

- Automatic dependency establishment

- Attribute population from template defaults

- Child task creation and linking

#
# 3. Dependency System

The dependency system supports complex task relationships and workflow orchestration.

#
## Dependency Types

**Completion Dependencies**: Sequential execution requirements

- Task B cannot start until Task A completes

- Most common dependency type

- Supports conditional completion (success vs. any completion)

**Data Dependencies**: Output-input relationships

- Task B requires specific output from Task A

- Enables data flow between tasks

- Supports transformation and validation of passed data

**Approval Dependencies**: Human or automated gates

- Task requires explicit approval before proceeding

- Supports multi-approver workflows

- Enables automatic approval based on criteria

**Resource Dependencies**: Shared resource constraints

- Tasks sharing limited resources (environments, personnel)

- Enables resource scheduling and conflict resolution

- Supports resource allocation and queuing

#
## Dependency Resolution

- **Automatic**: System resolves dependencies as tasks complete

- **Conditional**: Dependencies based on task outcomes or attributes

- **Cross-Chain**: Dependencies spanning multiple task chains

- **Circular Detection**: Prevention and detection of circular dependencies

#
# 4. Prerequisites System

Prerequisites define conditions that must be satisfied before task completion, enabling quality gates and compliance requirements.

#
## Prerequisite Types

**Automatic Prerequisites**: System-checkable conditions

- Code builds successfully

- All tests pass

- Security scans complete

- Performance benchmarks met

**Manual Prerequisites**: Human-verified conditions

- Design review approved

- Documentation updated

- Stakeholder sign-off received

- Compliance requirements met

**External Prerequisites**: Third-party system conditions

- External API availability

- Environment readiness

- Data migration completion

- Integration test passage

#
## Prerequisite Examples

- "Version number must be updated in package.json"

- "All automated tests must pass"

- "Two code review approvals required"

- "Security scan must show no critical vulnerabilities"

- "Performance regression test must pass"

- "Documentation must be updated"

#
## Prerequisite Validation

- **Continuous Checking**: Real-time validation of automatic prerequisites

- **Manual Validation**: User interface for manual prerequisite confirmation

- **Batch Validation**: Periodic checking of external prerequisites

- **Override Capability**: Administrative override for exceptional cases

#
# 5. Lifecycle Management

The lifecycle management system provides comprehensive state tracking and transition control.

#
## Lifecycle Stages

**Draft**: Task created but not ready for execution

- Initial stage for new tasks

- Allows for task refinement and preparation

- No dependencies checked or resolved

**Ready**: Task prepared and dependencies satisfied

- All prerequisites met

- Dependencies resolved

- Ready for assignment and execution

**Active**: Task currently being executed

- Assigned to specialist or system

- Progress tracking enabled

- Resource allocation active

**Blocked**: Task execution prevented by external factors

- Dependency failures or changes

- Resource unavailability

- External system issues

**Review**: Task completion pending validation

- Work completed but requires verification

- Quality assurance in progress

- Approval workflows active

**Completed**: Task successfully finished

- All prerequisites satisfied

- Deliverables produced and validated

- Ready for dependent task activation

**Archived**: Task stored for historical reference

- No longer active in workflows

- Preserved for audit and reference

- Minimal system resource impact

**Superseded**: Task replaced by newer version

- Made obsolete by updated requirements

- Replaced by better approach or solution

- Maintains reference for historical context

#
## Event Emission

Each lifecycle transition emits events for system integration:

- `task.stage_changed`: General stage transition event

- `task.ready`: Task becomes ready for execution

- `task.activated`: Task begins active execution

- `task.blocked`: Task becomes blocked

- `task.completed`: Task completes successfully

- `task.superseded`: Task is superseded by another

#
## Automatic Detection

- **Supersession Detection**: Identifies when tasks become obsolete

- **Dependency Changes**: Detects when dependencies change state

- **Resource Conflicts**: Identifies resource allocation conflicts

- **Circular Dependencies**: Prevents and detects circular dependencies

#
# Integration Points

- **Database Layer**: Persistent storage of task state and relationships

- **Event System**: Lifecycle events for external system integration

- **Template Engine**: Template instantiation and management

- **Dependency Resolver**: Automatic dependency checking and resolution

- **Validation Engine**: Prerequisite checking and validation

- **Notification System**: Status change notifications and alerts
