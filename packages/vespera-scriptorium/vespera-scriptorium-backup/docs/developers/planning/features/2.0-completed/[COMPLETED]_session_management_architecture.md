# 🔧 Feature Specification: Session Management Architecture

**Feature ID**: `SESSION_MANAGEMENT_V1`  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Core Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks (Completed)  
**Created**: 2025-06-02  
**Status**: Completed  

#
# 📋 Overview

A comprehensive session management system that enables persistent orchestration sessions with state preservation, multi-client support, and graceful session transitions. This feature provides the foundation for all task orchestration workflows.

#
# 🎯 Objectives

1. **Session Initialization**: Create and configure orchestration sessions with workspace detection

2. **State Persistence**: Maintain task state and context across server restarts and client reconnections  

3. **Multi-Client Support**: Allow multiple clients to connect to the same orchestration session

4. **Session Recovery**: Automatic session restoration after server restarts or client disconnections

5. **Workspace Integration**: Intelligent workspace detection and configuration

#
# 🛠️ Proposed Implementation

#
## New Tools/Functions (Implemented)

- `orchestrator_initialize_session`: Creates new orchestration sessions with workspace guidance

- `orchestrator_get_status`: Retrieves current session state and active tasks

- `orchestrator_synthesize_results`: Combines completed work across session context

#
## Database Changes (Implemented)

- Session state tables with workspace associations

- Task-session relationship management

- Session metadata and configuration storage

#
## Integration Points

- MCP server integration with session context

- Database persistence layer for session state

- Workspace detection through `.git`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` markers

- Client connection management and session binding

#
# 🔄 Implementation Approach

#
## Phase 1: Core Session Management (Completed)

- Session initialization and configuration system

- Workspace detection and association logic

- Basic session state persistence

#
## Phase 2: Multi-Client Support (Completed)

- Client registration and session binding

- Concurrent access management

- Session sharing and coordination

#
# 📊 Benefits

#
## Immediate Benefits

- Persistent task orchestration across sessions

- Reliable state management for complex workflows

- Multi-client collaboration capabilities

- Automatic workspace configuration

#
## Long-term Benefits

- Foundation for advanced collaboration features

- Scalable orchestration architecture

- Enhanced developer experience with session continuity

- Support for complex multi-phase projects

#
# 🔍 Success Metrics

- **Session Persistence**: 100% state preservation across server restarts

- **Multi-Client Support**: Multiple simultaneous client connections per session

- **Workspace Detection**: Automatic detection of 95%+ project types

- **Recovery Time**: Sub-5 second session restoration after reconnection

#
# 🎯 Migration Strategy

Session management was implemented as part of the core v2.0 architecture with automatic migration from legacy session handling. No manual migration required.

#
# 📝 Additional Considerations

#
## Risks and Mitigation

- **Session Conflicts**: Resolved through client coordination and locking mechanisms

- **State Corruption**: Mitigated with transaction-based state updates and backup systems

#
## Dependencies

- SQLite database for session persistence

- MCP server infrastructure

- Workspace detection utilities
