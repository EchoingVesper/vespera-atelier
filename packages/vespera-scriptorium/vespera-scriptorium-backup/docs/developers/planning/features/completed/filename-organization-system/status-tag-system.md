# üè∑Ô∏è Status Tag System

Comprehensive specification for document status tags and lifecycle management.

#
# Primary Status Tags

Status tags indicate the current phase of a document's lifecycle:

| Tag | Description | Use Cases | Color Code |
|-----|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **[RESEARCH]** | Analysis and investigation phase | Requirements gathering, feasibility studies, current state analysis | üîµ Blue |
| **[APPROVED]** | Ready for implementation | Completed specifications, approved designs, validated requirements | üü¢ Green |
| **[IN-PROGRESS]** | Currently being worked on | Active development, ongoing documentation, implementation phase | üü° Yellow |
| **[TESTING]** | Implementation complete, testing phase | Verification, validation, quality assurance | üü£ Purple |
| **[COMPLETED]** | Fully implemented and validated | well-tested, documented features, finished components | ‚úÖ Green Check |
| **[ARCHIVED]** | Deprecated or cancelled | Obsolete features, cancelled projects, superseded documents | ‚ö´ Gray |
| **[BLOCKED]** | Waiting on dependencies | Pending external input, blocked by other work, resource constraints | üî¥ Red |

#
# Secondary Status Tags (Optional)

Additional context for specific situations:

| Tag | Description | Use Cases |
|-----|-------------|-----------||
| **[HIGH-PRIORITY]** | Urgent implementation needed | Critical fixes, blocking issues, time-sensitive features |
| **[LOW-PRIORITY]** | Future consideration | Nice-to-have features, optimization, long-term improvements |
| **[EXPERIMENTAL]** | Proof of concept | Research spikes, experimental features, early prototypes |
| **[DEPRECATED]** | Being phased out | Legacy systems, outdated approaches, migration targets |
| **[SECURITY]** | Security-related content | Security fixes, threat analysis, compliance requirements |
| **[BREAKING]** | Contains breaking changes | API changes, schema migrations, compatibility issues |

#
# File Naming Convention

#
## Standard Format

```text
[PRIMARY_STATUS]_descriptive_file_name.md
[PRIMARY_STATUS]_[SECONDARY_STATUS]_descriptive_file_name.md

```text

#
## Examples

```text
text
‚úÖ Good Examples:
[RESEARCH]_enhanced_session_management_architecture.md
[APPROVED]_database_schema_enhancements.md
[IN-PROGRESS]_mcp_tools_implementation.md
[COMPLETED]_installation_guide_update.md
[BLOCKED]_[HIGH-PRIORITY]_github_integration_fix.md
[TESTING]_bidirectional_persistence_system.md
[ARCHIVED]_legacy_task_management_approach.md

‚ùå Bad Examples:
enhanced_session_management.md (no status tag)
[research]_session_management.md (lowercase tag)
[IN-PROGRESS][HIGH-PRIORITY]_feature.md (no separation)
very_long_descriptive_filename_that_exceeds_reasonable_length.md (too long)

```text

#
## Filename Requirements

1. **Status Tag**: Must be the first element in square brackets

2. **Descriptive Name**: Clear, concise description using underscores

3. **Length Limit**: Maximum 80 characters total filename

4. **Case Convention**: Status tags in UPPERCASE, filenames in lowercase_with_underscores

5. **Extension**: `.md` for documentation files

## Normal Progression

1. **[RESEARCH]** ‚Üí **[APPROVED]** ‚Üí **[IN-PROGRESS]** ‚Üí **[TESTING]** ‚Üí **[COMPLETED]**

#
## Alternative Paths

- Any status ‚Üí **[ARCHIVED]** (cancellation or obsolescence)

- Any status ‚Üí **[BLOCKED]** (waiting on dependencies)

- **[BLOCKED]** ‚Üí Previous status (when unblocked)

#
## Status Transition Rules

#
### From [RESEARCH]

- ‚úÖ **To [APPROVED]**: When specifications are complete and validated

- ‚úÖ **To [ARCHIVED]**: When research concludes feature is not viable

- ‚úÖ **To [BLOCKED]**: When research requires external dependencies

#
### From [APPROVED]

- ‚úÖ **To [IN-PROGRESS]**: When implementation begins

- ‚úÖ **To [ARCHIVED]**: When priorities change or feature is cancelled

- ‚úÖ **To [BLOCKED]**: When implementation dependencies are not met

#
### From [IN-PROGRESS]

- ‚úÖ **To [TESTING]**: When implementation is complete

- ‚úÖ **To [APPROVED]**: When scope changes require re-approval

- ‚úÖ **To [BLOCKED]**: When implementation encounters blockers

- ‚úÖ **To [ARCHIVED]**: When work is abandoned

#
### From [TESTING]

- ‚úÖ **To [COMPLETED]**: When all tests pass and validation is complete

- ‚úÖ **To [IN-PROGRESS]**: When significant issues require rework

- ‚úÖ **To [BLOCKED]**: When testing reveals dependency issues

#
### From [COMPLETED]

- ‚úÖ **To [ARCHIVED]**: When feature becomes obsolete

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **To [IN-PROGRESS]**: Only for major revisions (discouraged)
