# Core Components Architecture

This document specifies the architectural components of the Enhanced Session Management system.

#
# Component Layers

The architecture is organized into five distinct layers:

#
## Session Management Layer

```text
Session Management Layer
├── Session Manager (Core orchestration)
├── Active Session Context (Single active session state)
├── Session State Machine (Lifecycle management)
└── Session Registry (Multiple session storage)

```text

**Session Manager**: Central coordination point for all session operations, enforcing single active session constraint and managing session lifecycle transitions.

**Active Session Context**: Maintains state and context for the currently active session, providing optimized access to session-specific data and configurations.

**Session State Machine**: Implements the formal session lifecycle with defined states (inactive, active, paused, completed, archived, failed) and valid transitions.

**Session Registry**: Persistent storage and indexing of all sessions across the system, supporting session discovery and reactivation.

#
## Task Organization Layer

```text
text
Task Organization Layer  
├── Task Group Manager (Hierarchical organization)
├── Task Dependency Engine (Enhanced dependencies)
├── Task Lifecycle Coordinator (State management)
└── Progress Aggregation Engine (Recursive progress)

```text

**Task Group Manager**: Organizes tasks into logical groups within sessions (e.g., 'frontend', 'backend', 'documentation'), supporting hierarchical task organization.

**Task Dependency Engine**: Enhanced dependency management supporting complex prerequisite relationships, blocking relationships, and cross-session dependencies.

**Task Lifecycle Coordinator**: Manages task state transitions, ensuring consistency with session state and dependency constraints.

**Progress Aggregation Engine**: Calculates session-level progress by recursively aggregating task completion percentages with configurable weighting strategies.

#
## Persistence Layer

```text
text
Persistence Layer
├── Database Persistence (SQLite with enhanced schema)
├── Markdown File Generator (Human-readable files)
├── Bi-directional Sync Engine (DB ↔ .md sync)
└── File System Monitor (Change detection)

```text

**Database Persistence**: Enhanced SQLite schema optimized for session-aware operations with proper indexing and referential integrity.

**Markdown File Generator**: Creates and maintains human-readable session markdown files with standardized structure and task organization.

**Bi-directional Sync Engine**: Synchronizes changes between database and markdown files, supporting both programmatic updates and manual file editing.

**File System Monitor**: Detects external changes to markdown files and triggers sync operations to maintain data consistency.

#
## Mode & Configuration Layer

```text
text
Mode & Configuration Layer
├── Mode Manager (Role configuration system)
├── Role Configuration Engine (Dynamic role loading)
├── Session-Mode Binding (Session-specific behavior)
└── Recovery System (Missing file handling)

```text

**Mode Manager**: Manages the library of available modes and their associated role configurations, supporting mode discovery and validation.

**Role Configuration Engine**: Dynamically loads and validates YAML role configurations, providing session-specific specialist behavior.

**Session-Mode Binding**: Links sessions to specific modes, allowing session-specific behavior customization and role specialization.

**Recovery System**: Handles missing or corrupted role configuration files with fallback strategies and automatic recovery procedures.

#
## Integration Layer

```text
text
Integration Layer
├── MCP Tool Router (Enhanced tool suite)
├── Backward Compatibility Adapter (Legacy support)
├── A2A Framework Integration (Agent coordination)
└── External Tool Coordination (Multi-server support)
```text

**MCP Tool Router**: Routes MCP requests to appropriate session-aware implementations, maintaining clean separation between session and legacy operations.

**Backward Compatibility Adapter**: Provides seamless backward compatibility for existing task-only workflows during migration period.

**A2A Framework Integration**: Integrates with Agent-to-Agent framework for coordinated multi-agent task execution within session context.

**External Tool Coordination**: Coordinates with external MCP servers and tools while maintaining session context and state consistency.

#
# Architectural Patterns

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with defined interfaces between layers

- **State Machine Pattern**: Formal state management for sessions and tasks

- **Observer Pattern**: File system monitoring and change detection

- **Adapter Pattern**: Backward compatibility and external integration

- **Strategy Pattern**: Configurable role and mode behavior

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for persistence layer

#
# Quality Attributes

- **Performance**: Optimized database schema with strategic indexing

- **Scalability**: Support for multiple sessions and large task hierarchies

- **Maintainability**: Clear layer separation and modular design

- **Reliability**: State consistency and recovery mechanisms

- **Usability**: Human-readable persistence and intuitive session management
