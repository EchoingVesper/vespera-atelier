# Project Cleanup Safety Framework

#

# Git Safety Strategy

#

#

# Backup Status

- **Main branch preserved**: All changes on dedicated cleanup branch

- **Branch**: `project-organization-cleanup/comprehensive-v1.6.0`

- **Stash backup**: Pre-cleanup stash created with uncommitted changes

- **Rollback capability**: `git checkout main` restores original state

#

#

# Validation Checkpoints

#

#

#

# Phase 1: Infrastructure Complete ✅

- [x] Git backup strategy implemented

- [x] Dedicated cleanup branch created

- [x] Missing directories created: `docs/releases/`, `scripts/testing/`

- [x] Working directory preserved on cleanup branch

#

#

#

# Phase 2: Build Cleanup (Pending)

- [ ] Build artifacts removed safely

- [ ] Python cache cleaned

- [ ] Package import functionality verified

- [ ] Checkpoint: Clean build state

#

#

#

# Phase 3: Environment Cleanup (Pending)

- [ ] Virtual environments assessed

- [ ] 5 extra venvs removed (keep venv_mcp)

- [ ] .gitignore updated with Claude Code patterns

- [ ] Checkpoint: Clean environment state

#

#

#

# Phase 4: Script Reorganization (Pending)

- [ ] 24 scripts categorized and moved

- [ ] Internal references updated

- [ ] Functionality tested in new locations

- [ ] Checkpoint: Scripts properly organized

#

#

#

# Phase 5: Documentation Reorganization (Pending)

- [ ] 22 documentation files moved

- [ ] Duplicate files handled

- [ ] Internal links updated

- [ ] Checkpoint: Documentation well-organized

#

#

#

# Phase 6: Testing & Validation (Pending)

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite passed

- [ ] Package installation verified

- [ ] Import functionality confirmed

- [ ] MCP server functionality validated

- [ ] Checkpoint: Full functionality preserved

#

#

#

# Phase 7: Structure Validation (Pending)

- [ ] Diagnostic script confirms 95+ health score

- [ ] Automation tools functional

- [ ] Monitoring procedures in place

- [ ] Checkpoint: Automation in place

#

#

#

# Phase 8: Final Integration (Pending)

- [ ] Health score target achieved (95+)

- [ ] Professional repository status

- [ ] Documentation complete

- [ ] Ready for production

#

# Emergency Rollback Procedure

```bash

# Return to main branch (discards all cleanup changes)

git checkout main

# Or partial rollback to specific checkpoint

git checkout project-organization-cleanup/comprehensive-v1.6.0
git reset --hard <checkpoint-commit-hash>

# Restore original uncommitted changes if needed

git stash list
git stash apply stash@{1}  

# Pre-cleanup stash

```text

#

# Validation Commands

```text
bash

# Health check at each phase

python scripts/diagnostics/check-project-structure.py

# Test functionality

python -c "import mcp_task_orchestrator; print('Import success')"

# Run core tests

python simple_test_runner.py

# Check git status

git status --porcelain
```text

#

# Success Metrics Tracking

- **Root files**: Target ≤15 (from 60) - 75% reduction

- **Health score**: Target 95+ (from 10) - 850% improvement  

- **Virtual environments**: Target 1 (from 6) - 83% reduction

- **Professional organization**: Achieved through systematic cleanup

#

# Safety Notes

1. **All changes are on cleanup branch** - main branch remains untouched

2. **Atomic operations** - Each phase can be rolled back independently

3. **Validation gates** - Progress only after confirming functionality

4. **Comprehensive testing** - Full test suite at each major checkpoint

5. **Functionality preservation** - Zero loss of existing capabilities
