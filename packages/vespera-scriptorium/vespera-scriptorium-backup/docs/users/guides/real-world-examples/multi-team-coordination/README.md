# Multi-Team Coordination Examples

*Orchestrating complex workflows across distributed development teams*

#

# 🌟 Overview

Multi-team coordination requires careful management of dependencies, resource conflicts, and communication workflows. These examples demonstrate how Task Orchestrator coordinates work across teams while Claude Code handles individual team's file operations and implementations.

#

# 📂 Examples in This Directory

#

#

# 🏢 **Enterprise Feature Release** (`enterprise-feature-rollout.md`)

- Cross-team feature development with shared dependencies

- API contract negotiation and validation workflows

- Staged deployment with team-specific rollback capabilities

- Progress tracking and stakeholder communication automation

#

#

# 🔄 **Shared Library Migration** (`shared-library-upgrade.md`)

- Coordinated library upgrades across 15+ microservices

- Breaking change communication and migration planning

- Team-specific validation and approval workflows

- Dependency conflict resolution and rollback strategies

#

#

# 📊 **Release Train Coordination** (`quarterly-release-train.md`)

- Quarterly release planning across 8 development teams

- Feature freeze coordination and exception handling

- Integration testing with cross-team dependencies

- Documentation and deployment coordination

#

# 🔗 Key Integration Patterns

- **Dependency Orchestration**: Managing shared resources and blocking relationships

- **Communication Automation**: Automated status updates and notification workflows

- **Conflict Resolution**: Resource locking and team priority management

- **Progress Aggregation**: Real-time visibility across all team contributions

- **Rollback Coordination**: Team-specific and system-wide rollback capabilities

#

# 🎯 When to Use These Patterns

- Large-scale feature development with multiple contributing teams

- Shared infrastructure changes affecting multiple services

- Coordinated releases requiring cross-team synchronization

- Complex dependency management in microservice architectures
