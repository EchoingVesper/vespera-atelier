# Data Processing Examples

*Orchestrating complex data pipelines with confidence and reliability*

#

# ðŸŒŸ Overview

Data processing workflows require careful coordination between extraction, transformation, validation, and storage phases. These examples demonstrate how Task Orchestrator coordinates data pipeline tasks while Claude Code handles file operations, analysis, and processing.

# ðŸ“Š Examples in This Directory

#

#

# ðŸ”„ **ETL Pipeline Orchestration** (`etl-pipeline-automation.md`)

- Multi-source data extraction

- Parallel transformation workflows  

- Quality validation checkpoints

- Incremental loading strategies

- Error handling and recovery patterns

#

#

# ðŸ“ˆ **Sales Analytics Workflow** (`sales-analytics-pipeline.md`)

- CSV/Excel data ingestion

- Data cleaning and normalization

- Statistical analysis and reporting

- Automated visualization generation

- Multi-format output delivery

#

#

# ðŸ§ª **Data Quality Assurance** (`data-quality-pipeline.md`)

- Schema validation automation

- Anomaly detection workflows

- Data lineage tracking

- Quality metrics reporting

- Automated correction workflows

#

# ðŸ”— Key Integration Patterns

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple data sources processed simultaneously

- **Checkpoint Coordination**: Validation gates between pipeline stages

- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of data quality issues

- **Resource Management**: Memory and storage optimization

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time pipeline status monitoring

#

# ðŸŽ¯ When to Use These Patterns

- Processing large datasets requiring staged validation

- Multiple data sources needing coordination

- Complex transformations requiring specialist oversight

- Quality assurance workflows with human review points

- Automated reporting requiring multiple output formats
