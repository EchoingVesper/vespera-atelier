# Legacy Modernization Examples

*Orchestrating large-scale technology transformations with confidence*

#

# 🌟 Overview

Legacy modernization requires careful coordination between analysis, refactoring, testing, and deployment phases. These examples demonstrate how Task Orchestrator manages complex modernization workflows while Claude Code handles the actual code transformations.

# 📂 Examples in This Directory

#

#

# 🔄 **Monolith to Microservices** (`monolith-decomposition.md`)

- Legacy application analysis and service boundary identification

- Incremental extraction patterns with zero-downtime deployment

- Database decomposition and data migration strategies

- API gateway integration and service mesh coordination

#

#

# 📦 **Framework Migration** (`framework-upgrade-automation.md`)

- Large-scale dependency upgrades (React 16→18, Angular 12→17)

- Breaking change detection and automated code transformation

- Test suite migration and validation workflows

- Gradual rollout strategies with rollback capabilities

#

#

# 🗄️ **Database Modernization** (`database-migration-pipeline.md`)

- Schema evolution planning and execution

- Data migration with validation checkpoints

- Legacy system integration during transition

- Performance optimization and monitoring setup

#

# 🔗 Key Integration Patterns

- **Phased Rollouts**: Incremental changes with validation gates

- **Rollback Safety**: Automated reversion capabilities at each phase

- **Impact Analysis**: Dependency mapping and change impact assessment

- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and manual approval workflows

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time modernization progress monitoring

#

# 🎯 When to Use These Patterns

- Large codebases requiring systematic transformation

- Mission-critical systems needing zero-downtime migration

- Complex dependency chains requiring careful orchestration

- Multi-team coordination for Large-scale modernization
