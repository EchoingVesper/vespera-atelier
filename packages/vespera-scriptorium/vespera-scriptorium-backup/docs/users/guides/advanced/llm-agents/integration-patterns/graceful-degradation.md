# Graceful Degradation Pattern

*1650 char limit - Fallback strategies for server unavailability*

#

# Pattern Overview

Maintain workflow continuity when MCP servers become unavailable. Provides fallback strategies and alternative execution paths for critical operations.

#

# Implementation Steps

#

#

# Phase 1: Capability Detection

```text

1. orchestrator_initialize_session() - Test server availability

2. Identify critical vs. optional server dependencies

3. Plan primary and fallback execution paths

```text

#

#

# Phase 2: Primary Execution with Monitoring

```text

4. Attempt primary workflow with full server capability

5. Monitor for server timeout or unavailability signals

6. Catch server communication failures gracefully

```text

#

#

# Phase 3: Degraded Mode Execution

```text

7. Switch to manual/alternative execution methods

8. Maintain core functionality with reduced automation

9. Document degraded operations for later optimization

#

# Degradation Strategies

#

#

# File Operations Fallback

- **Primary**: Claude Code file operations

- **Fallback**: Manual file descriptions, code suggestions

#

#

# Analysis Fallback  

- **Primary**: Automated code/data analysis

- **Fallback**: Guided manual analysis with checklists

#

#

# Execution Fallback

- **Primary**: Automated task execution

- **Fallback**: Step-by-step manual instructions

#

# Recovery Procedures

- **Detection**: Monitor for server restoration

- **Transition**: Seamlessly return to full automation

- **Sync**: Update any manual changes made during degradation

**Use When**: Critical deadlines, unreliable infrastructure, backup planning
