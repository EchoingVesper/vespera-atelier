# Legacy Modernization Context

*1950 char limit - Legacy system upgrade coordination patterns*

#

# Context: Legacy System Modernization

Use for monolith decomposition, framework migrations, API modernization, and infrastructure upgrades.

#

# Workflow Pattern

#

#

# 1. Legacy Analysis (Researcher)

- Current system assessment, dependency mapping, technical debt analysis

- Migration scope definition, risk identification, compatibility review

#

#

# 2. Modernization Architecture (Architect)

- Target architecture design, migration strategy, integration patterns

- Technology selection, security considerations, performance planning

#

#

# 3. Incremental Implementation (Implementer)

- Phased migration execution, backward compatibility, integration bridges

- Component modernization, testing infrastructure, deployment automation

#

#

# 4. Quality Assurance (Reviewer/Tester)

- Migration validation, functionality preservation, performance comparison

- Rollback procedures, risk mitigation, user acceptance testing

#

# Integration with Claude Code

**Analysis**: Orchestrator plans assessment, Claude Code analyzes legacy code
**Architecture**: Orchestrator designs migration, Claude Code validates approaches
**Implementation**: Orchestrator coordinates phases, Claude Code handles transformations
**Testing**: Combined validation of legacy vs. modern functionality

#

# Key Coordination Points

1. **Migration Phases**: Plan incremental, low-risk migration steps

2. **Compatibility**: Maintain functionality during transition

3. **Risk Management**: Rollback strategies and validation gates

4. **Team Coordination**: Minimize disruption to ongoing development

5. **Documentation**: Preserve knowledge and update procedures
