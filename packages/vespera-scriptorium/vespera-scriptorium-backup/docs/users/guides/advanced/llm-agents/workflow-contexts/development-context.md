# Development Workflow Context

*2000 char limit - Development coordination patterns*

#

# Context: Software Development Projects

Use for coordinating development workflows with multiple files, testing, and deployment.

#

# Workflow Pattern

#

#

# 1. Architecture Planning (Architect)

- System design, component structure, technology selection

- Dependency analysis, security and performance considerations

#

#

# 2. Implementation Coordination (Implementer) 

- Core functionality, component integration, error handling

- Code organization and modularity

#

#

# 3. Testing Strategy (Tester)

- Unit/integration testing, performance and security testing

- Test automation setup

#

#

# 4. Review and Quality (Reviewer)

- Code quality, architecture review, documentation completeness

#

# Integration with Claude Code

**Planning**: Orchestrator designs workflow, identifies files/dependencies
**Implementation**: Claude Code handles file operations, code analysis, execution  
**Testing**: Orchestrator coordinates tests, Claude Code runs them
**Review**: Combined analysis of code quality and architecture

#

# Key Coordination Points

1. **File Dependencies**: Plan creation/modification order

2. **Build Process**: Coordinate compilation and dependencies

3. **Testing Sequence**: Manage test execution and validation

4. **Documentation**: Sync code and docs

5. **Deployment**: Coordinate build, test, deploy pipeline

#

# Specialist Assignments

- **Architect**: System design, architecture decisions

- **Implementer**: Core development, features

- **Tester**: Test creation, validation, automation

- **Reviewer**: Quality assurance, code review

- **Debugger**: Issue resolution, optimization

- **Documenter**: Documentation creation/maintenance

**Use for**: Full-stack apps, APIs, libraries, microservices
