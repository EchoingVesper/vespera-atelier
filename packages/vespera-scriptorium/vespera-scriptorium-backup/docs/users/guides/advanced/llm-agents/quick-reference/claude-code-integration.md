# Claude Code Integration Patterns

*1500 char limit - Key coordination patterns*

#

# Integration Architecture

**Task Orchestrator**: Planning, coordination, workflow state
**Claude Code**: File operations, code execution, implementation

#

# Sequential Pattern (Recommended)

1. `orchestrator_initialize_session()` - Start orchestration

2. `orchestrator_plan_task()` - Create structured subtasks  

3. `orchestrator_execute_subtask(task_id)` - Get specialist context

4. **Use Claude Code tools** - File operations, implementation

5. `orchestrator_complete_subtask()` - Record results

6. **Repeat 3-5** for each subtask

7. `orchestrator_synthesize_results()` - Final output

#

# Resource Coordination

#

#

# File Operations

- **Orchestrator**: Plans which files to work on, manages dependencies

- **Claude Code**: Executes file reading, writing, editing operations

#

#

# State Management  

- **Orchestrator**: Task progress, dependencies, workflow state

- **Claude Code**: File system state, execution context

#

#

# Error Handling

- **Orchestrator**: Workflow-level recovery, retry coordination

- **Claude Code**: File-level errors, execution failures

#

# Best Practices

- Always plan with orchestrator before using Claude Code

- Use specific specialist types for focused operations

- Complete subtasks before moving to next operation

- Maintain shared context between both systems
