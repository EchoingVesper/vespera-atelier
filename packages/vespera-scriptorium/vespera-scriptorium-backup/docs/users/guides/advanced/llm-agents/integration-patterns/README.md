# LLM Agent Integration Patterns

*Character-optimized coordination patterns for multi-server workflows*

#

# Overview

Integration patterns define how to coordinate between Task Orchestrator and other MCP servers (especially Claude Code) for different execution scenarios and requirements.

#

# Available Patterns

#

#

# 🔄 [Sequential Coordination](sequential-coordination.md) **[CORE]**

**Use for**: File operations, complex workflows, multi-step processes
**Benefits**: No conflicts, clear dependencies, progress tracking
**Pattern**: Initialize → Plan → Execute → Complete → Synthesize

#

#

# ⚡ [Parallel Execution](parallel-execution.md)

**Use for**: Independent file operations, parallel analysis, concurrent validations
**Benefits**: Speed, resource efficiency, scalability
**Pattern**: Analyze Dependencies → Launch Parallel → Synchronize → Integrate

#

#

# 🛡️ [Graceful Degradation](graceful-degradation.md)

**Use for**: Critical deadlines, unreliable infrastructure, backup planning
**Benefits**: Continuity, fallback strategies, recovery procedures
**Pattern**: Detect Capability → Monitor Execution → Degrade Gracefully → Recover

#

#

# 🌐 [Multi-Server Coordination](multi-server-coordination.md)

**Use for**: Enterprise workflows, specialized tool requirements, complex integrations
**Benefits**: Specialized capabilities, complex data flows, enterprise scale
**Pattern**: Plan Multi-Server → Coordinate Execution → Cross-Server Synthesis

#

# Pattern Selection Guide

- **Single complex workflow**: Sequential Coordination

- **Independent parallel tasks**: Parallel Execution  

- **Mission-critical reliability**: Graceful Degradation

- **Multiple specialized servers**: Multi-Server Coordination
