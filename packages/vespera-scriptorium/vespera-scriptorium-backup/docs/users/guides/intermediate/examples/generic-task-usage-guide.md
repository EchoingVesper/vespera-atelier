# Generic Task Model Usage Guide

> **⚠️ This guide has been restructured for better navigation and Claude Code safety**

#

# Navigation

This comprehensive guide has been split into focused sections for easier reading and to prevent Claude Code crashes from large files.

**📚 [Start Here: Complete Usage Guide](generic-task-usage/README.md)**

#

# Why This Change?

The original 1,172-line file was causing Claude Code to crash due to file size limits. The new modular structure:

- ✅ **Claude Code Safe**: All files under 500-line limit

- ✅ **Better Navigation**: Focused topics with clear links

- ✅ **Improved Maintenance**: Easier to update specific sections

- ✅ **Enhanced Search**: Find specific information faster
