# Maintenance Automation Examples

*Practical automation patterns for optimal system performance*

#

# Daily Automation Patterns

#

#

# Pattern 1: Morning Startup Routine

**Scenario**: Starting a new day of development work.

**Automated Workflow:**

```python

# Step 1: Initialize and assess situation

morning_startup = [
    "Initialize a new orchestration session",
    

# System automatically detects interrupted tasks

    "Review any interrupted tasks from previous session",
    "Use maintenance coordinator to scan current session with basic validation"
]

# Expected outcomes:

startup_results = {
    "session_recovery": "System shows any tasks that can be resumed",
    "health_check": "Basic system health assessment completed", 
    "cleanup_actions": "Any overnight issues automatically addressed",
    "recommendations": "Guidance for day's priorities"
}

# Example output interpretation:

"""
If system shows:

- 0 interrupted tasks: Clean start, begin new work

- 1-3 interrupted tasks: Review and decide to resume or archive

- >3 interrupted tasks: Run comprehensive cleanup first

- Health issues: Address before starting new work
"""

```text

**Implementation Example:**

```text
text
python

# Morning routine - copy-paste commands

morning_commands = [
    "Initialize orchestration session and show any resumable tasks",
    "Use maintenance coordinator to scan current session and show system health",
    "If health issues found, run comprehensive cleanup before starting new work"
]

# Decision tree based on results:

decision_tree = """
Interrupted tasks found:
├── 1-2 tasks → Review and resume valuable work
├── 3-5 tasks → Selective resume, archive completed
└── >5 tasks → Run comprehensive cleanup first

System health:
├── Good → Proceed with new work
├── Minor issues → Address during first break
└── Major issues → Run full maintenance before proceeding
"""

```text

#

#

# Pattern 2: End-of-Day Cleanup

**Scenario**: Preparing system for overnight and next day.

**Automated Workflow:**

```text
python

# End of day routine

evening_cleanup = [
    "Complete any in-progress subtasks with current status",
    "Use maintenance coordinator to scan current session with comprehensive validation", 
    "Use maintenance coordinator to prepare handover documentation",
    "Archive any completed workflows to optimize system"
]

# Handover preparation benefits:

handover_benefits = {
    "session_continuity": "Clear resume instructions for tomorrow",
    "context_preservation": "Important context saved without memory limits",
    "system_optimization": "Temporary data cleaned up for performance",
    "progress_tracking": "Clear record of day's accomplishments"
}

```text
text

**Evening Routine Template:**

```text
python

# Copy-paste evening commands

evening_commands = [
    

# Complete any partial work

    "If any tasks are partially done, complete them with current progress summary",
    
    

# System health and cleanup  

    "Run maintenance scan with comprehensive validation on current session",
    
    

# Prepare for tomorrow

    "Use maintenance coordinator to prepare handover with comprehensive validation",
    
    

# Final status check

    "Show final status of all tasks and system health metrics"
]

# Expected handover package:

handover_package = """
Generated artifacts:

- Complete task status summary

- Progress documentation

- Next steps recommendations  

- Artifact organization

- System health report

- Resume instructions
"""
