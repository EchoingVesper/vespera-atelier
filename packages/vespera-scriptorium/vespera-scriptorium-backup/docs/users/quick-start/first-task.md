# Your First Task Orchestration

#

# Overview

This tutorial walks you through creating and executing your first task orchestration. You'll learn the basic workflow and see how specialists collaborate to solve problems.

#

# Basic Workflow

#

#

# Step 1: Initialize Orchestration

Start by initializing a new orchestration session:

```plaintext
Use the orchestrator_initialize tool with:

- task_description: "Create a simple Python calculator with basic operations"

- complexity: "basic"

- workspace_id: "my-first-project"

```text

**Expected Output**: Orchestration session created with unique ID

#

#

# Step 2: Create Task Plan

Generate a breakdown of your task:

```text
plaintext
Use the orchestrator_plan tool with your session ID

```text

**Expected Output**: 

- Task broken into logical subtasks

- Specialist assignments for each subtask

- Execution order and dependencies

#

#

# Step 3: Execute Tasks

Run the orchestrated execution:

```text
plaintext
Use the orchestrator_execute tool with your session ID

```text

**Expected Output**:

- Progress updates as specialists work

- Intermediate results and artifacts

- Completion notifications for each subtask

#

#

# Step 4: Synthesize Results

Combine all specialist outputs:

```text
plaintext
Use the orchestrator_synthesize tool with your session ID

```text

**Expected Output**:

- Complete Python calculator implementation

- Documentation and usage examples

- Test files and validation results

#

#

# Step 5: Complete Orchestration

Finalize and save the session:

```text
plaintext
Use the orchestrator_complete tool with your session ID

```text

**Expected Output**:

- Final deliverables packaged

- Session summary and metrics

- Artifacts stored for future reference

#

# Understanding the Process

#

#

# What Happened Behind the Scenes

1. **Architect** analyzed requirements and created implementation plan

2. **Implementer** wrote the Python calculator code

3. **Reviewer** validated code quality and functionality

4. **Documenter** created usage documentation and examples

5. **Orchestrator** coordinated all activities and synthesized results

#

#

# Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Automatic Task Breakdown**: Complex task split into manageable pieces

- **Specialist Expertise**: Each piece handled by appropriate expert

- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review and validation

- **Complete Deliverable**: Working code plus documentation

#

# Checking Your Results

#

#

# Verify Outputs

Look for these deliverables:

- `calculator.py` - Main implementation

- `README.md` - Usage documentation

- `test_calculator.py` - Test suite

- `examples.py` - Usage examples

#

#

# Test the Calculator

```text
python

# Basic usage example

from calculator import Calculator

calc = Calculator()
result = calc.add(5, 3)  

# Returns 8

```text

# Troubleshooting

#

#

# Common First-Time Issues

**Orchestration fails to start**: Check MCP client configuration
**Specialists not responding**: Verify tool availability
**Results incomplete**: Review task complexity setting
**Artifacts not saved**: Check workspace permissions
