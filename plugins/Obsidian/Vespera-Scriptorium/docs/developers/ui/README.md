# Vespera Scriptorium UI Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for the user interface components of Vespera Scriptorium.

## Available UI Documentation

- [MultiSelectModal Specification](MultiSelectModal_spec.md) - Specification for the multi-select modal component
- [Modular Architecture](ModularArchitecture.md) - Guidelines for the modular architecture of UI components

## UI Architecture

The UI components in Vespera Scriptorium are designed to:

1. **Provide a consistent user experience**: All UI components follow a consistent design language
2. **Be responsive**: UI components adapt to different screen sizes and device types
3. **Be accessible**: UI components follow accessibility best practices
4. **Be modular**: UI components can be reused across different parts of the application

## UI Component Structure

UI components in Vespera Scriptorium are organized as follows:

- **Base Components**: Fundamental UI building blocks (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- **Composite Components**: Components composed of multiple base components (modals, panels, etc.)
- **Views**: Complete UI views that combine multiple components (settings view, main view, etc.)

## UI Component Implementation

UI components are implemented using:

- **TypeScript**: For component logic
- **HTML/DOM Manipulation**: For rendering
- **CSS**: For styling
- **Obsidian API**: For integration with Obsidian's UI framework

## Developing UI Components

When developing a new UI component for Vespera Scriptorium:

1. **Define the component's purpose**: Clearly define what the component should do
2. **Create a specification**: Document the component's requirements and behavior
3. **Implement the component**: Create the component following the established patterns
4. **Test the component**: Verify that the component works as expected
5. **Document the component**: Create documentation explaining how to use the component

## UI Component Guidelines

### Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep UI components simple and focused
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for user actions
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible to all users

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate UI logic from business logic
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for communication between components
- **Responsive**: Design components to work on different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimize components for performance

## UI Testing

UI components should be tested using:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Visual Tests**: Verify component appearance
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify component accessibility

## Future UI Components

The following UI components are planned for future development:

- **Advanced Settings Panel**: For configuring complex settings
- **Document Preview**: For previewing processed documents
- **Progress Visualization**: For visualizing processing progress
- **Template Editor**: For creating and editing prompt templates
