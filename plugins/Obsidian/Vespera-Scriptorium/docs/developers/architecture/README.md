- [Feature Requirements Table (FRT)](FRT.md) - Specific feature requirements and implementation details
- [Module Roadmap](Module-Roadmap.md) - Planned modules and development roadmap

## Architecture Overview

Vespera Scriptorium is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for extensibility. The core components include:

### Core Modules

- **FileManager**: Handles file operations and interactions with the Obsidian vault
- **Parser**: Processes and parses document content
- **Chunker**: Divides documents into manageable chunks for processing
- **LLMClient**: Interfaces with language model providers
- **PromptTemplateManager**: Manages prompt templates for different operations
- **Writer**: Handles the generation and formatting of output content
- **UI**: Provides user interface components for interaction

### Data Flow

1. User selects a document or text to process
2. FileManager retrieves the content
3. Parser processes the content to extract structure and metadata
4. Chunker divides the content into appropriate chunks if necessary
5. LLMClient sends the content to the language model with prompts from PromptTemplateManager
6. Writer formats the results and saves or displays them
7. UI components handle user interaction throughout the process

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Extensibility**: New modules and features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Configurability**: Users can customize behavior through settings
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of documents, with chunking for large documents
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with appropriate feedback during processing

## Future Architecture Considerations

- **Plugin System**: Allow for third-party plugins to extend functionality
- **Advanced Caching**: Improve performance through intelligent caching
- **Multi-Model Support**: Support for multiple language models and switching between them
- **Collaborative Features**: Support for collaborative document processing
