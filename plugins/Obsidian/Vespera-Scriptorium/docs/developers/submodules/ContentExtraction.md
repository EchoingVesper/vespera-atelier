# Content Extraction Module - Developer Documentation

*Note: This module is planned for a future release and is not yet implemented.*

## Module Overview

The Content Extraction Module will be responsible for identifying and extracting specific types of information from documents. This module will use natural language processing techniques to recognize entities, facts, dates, events, and other structured information within unstructured text.

## Planned Architecture

### Core Components

- **ExtractorManager**: Coordinates the extraction process and manages different extractor types
- **EntityExtractor**: Identifies and extracts named entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.)
- **FactExtractor**: Identifies and extracts factual statements
- **DateEventExtractor**: Identifies and extracts dates, events, and timelines
- **TerminologyExtractor**: Identifies and extracts domain-specific terminology
- **CustomExtractor**: Allows for user-defined extraction rules

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface Extractor {
  extractFromText(text: string, options?: ExtractionOptions): ExtractionResult;
  getExtractorType(): string;
  getExtractorConfig(): ExtractionConfig;
}

interface ExtractionOptions {
  confidence: number;
  maxResults?: number;
  filters?: ExtractionFilter[];
  includeContext?: boolean;
  contextSize?: number;
}

interface ExtractionResult {
  extractions: Extraction[];
  metadata: ExtractionMetadata;
}

interface Extraction {
  type: string;
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  context?: string;
  position?: TextPosition;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Integration Points

The Content Extraction Module will integrate with:

- **Parser**: To receive processed document content
- **Chunker**: To process document chunks
- **LLMClient**: To leverage language models for extraction
- **Writer**: To format and output extraction results

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Basic entity extraction (people, organizations, locations)
2. **Phase 2**: Fact extraction and date/event extraction
3. **Phase 3**: Terminology extraction and custom extraction rules
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced extraction features and optimizations

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Extraction operations can be computationally intensive
- Consider implementing caching for extraction results
- Use chunking for processing large documents
- Implement parallel processing where appropriate

### Accuracy

- Implement confidence scoring for extractions
- Allow users to set minimum confidence thresholds
- Provide mechanisms for validating and correcting extractions
- Consider implementing multiple extraction methods and combining results

### Extensibility

- Design for easy addition of new extractor types
- Support for custom extraction rules
- Allow for integration with external NLP services

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual extractors
- Integration tests for the extraction pipeline
- Benchmark tests for performance evaluation
- Accuracy tests against labeled datasets

## User Experience Considerations

- Provide clear visualization of extracted information
- Allow for filtering and sorting of extractions
- Support for exporting extractions in various formats
- Enable user feedback to improve extraction accuracy

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with knowledge graphs
- Relationship extraction between entities
- Multi-language support
- Domain-specific extraction models
