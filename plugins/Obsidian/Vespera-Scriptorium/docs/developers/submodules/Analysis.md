# Analysis Module - Developer Documentation

*Note: This module is planned for a future release and is not yet implemented.*

## Module Overview

The Analysis Module will provide advanced document analysis capabilities, enabling users to gain deeper insights into their documents. This module will analyze content patterns, sentiment, topics, argument structure, and other aspects of document content.

## Planned Architecture

### Core Components

- **AnalysisManager**: Coordinates different types of analysis and manages results
- **SentimentAnalyzer**: Analyzes the emotional tone of text
- **TopicAnalyzer**: Identifies main topics and themes
- **ArgumentAnalyzer**: Identifies claims, evidence, and reasoning structures
- **ComparativeAnalyzer**: Compares multiple documents
- **ReadabilityAnalyzer**: Assesses readability and complexity

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface Analyzer {
  analyze(text: string, options?: AnalysisOptions): AnalysisResult;
  getAnalyzerType(): string;
  getAnalyzerConfig(): AnalysisConfig;
}

interface AnalysisOptions {
  depth: AnalysisDepth;
  focus?: string[];
  excludeAspects?: string[];
  maxResults?: number;
  includeEvidence?: boolean;
}

interface AnalysisResult {
  type: string;
  summary: string;
  aspects: AnalysisAspect[];
  confidence: number;
  metadata: AnalysisMetadata;
}

interface AnalysisAspect {
  name: string;
  value: any;
  confidence: number;
  evidence?: TextEvidence[];
}

enum AnalysisDepth {
  Basic,
  Standard,
  Detailed,
  Comprehensive
}
```

## Integration Points

The Analysis Module will integrate with:

- **Parser**: To receive processed document content
- **Chunker**: To process document chunks
- **LLMClient**: To leverage language models for analysis
- **Writer**: To format and output analysis results
- **ContentExtraction**: To analyze extracted information

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Basic sentiment analysis and readability assessment
2. **Phase 2**: Topic modeling and basic argument analysis
3. **Phase 3**: Comparative analysis and advanced argument analysis
4. **Phase 4**: Integration with other modules and advanced features

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Analysis operations can be computationally intensive
- Implement progressive analysis (quick results first, then more detailed)
- Use chunking for processing large documents
- Consider caching analysis results for repeated analyses

### Accuracy

- Implement confidence scoring for analysis results
- Provide evidence for analysis conclusions
- Allow for multiple analysis methods and consensus approaches
- Consider domain-specific analysis models

### Extensibility

- Design for easy addition of new analyzer types
- Support for custom analysis rules and metrics
- Allow for integration with external analysis services

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual analyzers
- Integration tests for the analysis pipeline
- Benchmark tests for performance evaluation
- Accuracy tests against labeled datasets
- User testing for result interpretation and usefulness

## User Experience Considerations

- Present analysis results in an intuitive and actionable format
- Provide visualizations for complex analysis results
- Allow for drilling down into evidence and details
- Enable comparison of analysis results across documents
- Support for exporting analysis results

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time analysis during document editing
- Collaborative analysis with multiple users
- Custom analysis templates for specific document types
- Integration with external knowledge bases
- Multi-language support
- Domain-specific analysis models
