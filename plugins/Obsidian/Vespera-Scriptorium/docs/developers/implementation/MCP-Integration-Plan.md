# MCP Server Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the Vespera Scriptorium plugin, specifically focusing on the Obsidian MCP server for enhanced document processing and interaction capabilities.

## Goals

1. Seamlessly integrate with Obsidian's ecosystem using MCP
2. Enable secure and efficient document processing
3. Provide a flexible architecture for future MCP server support
4. Maintain compatibility with the existing robust document processing pipeline

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Integration (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Environment Setup

- [ ] Install Obsidian REST API plugin
- [ ] Configure API key and permissions
- [ ] Set up development environment for MCP server

### 1.2 MCP Server Implementation

- [ ] Implement MCP server adapter interface
- [ ] Create configuration manager for MCP settings
- [ ] Add error handling and logging

### 1.3 Core Integration

- [ ] Implement file system operations via MCP
- [ ] Add document search and retrieval
- [ ] Set up content modification capabilities

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Document Processing

- [ ] Integrate with existing processing pipeline
- [ ] Implement chunking and batching for large documents
- [ ] Add metadata handling

### 2.2 UI Integration

- [ ] Add MCP status indicators
- [ ] Create settings panel for MCP configuration
- [ ] Implement error reporting and notifications

### 2.3 Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement caching for frequent operations
- [ ] Add rate limiting and backoff strategies
- [ ] Optimize network requests

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Week 5)

### 3.1 Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for MCP adapter
- [ ] Integration tests with Obsidian
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing

### 3.2 Documentation

- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Create user guide for MCP features
- [ ] Document API endpoints and usage

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Adapter Interface

```typescript
interface MCPAdapter {
  // File operations
  readFile(path: string): Promise<string>;
  writeFile(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Search and query
  search(query: string): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  
  // Document processing
  processDocument(path: string, pipeline: string[]): Promise<ProcessedDocument>;
  
  // System status
  getStatus(): Promise<MCPStatus>;
}
```

### Configuration

```typescript
interface MCPConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  serverUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  vaultPath: string;
  cacheTtl: number;
  rateLimit: {
    requests: number;
    interval: number;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

- Implement retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for MCP server failures
- Graceful degradation when MCP is unavailable
- Detailed error reporting and logging

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage of API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging of sensitive operations

## Performance Considerations

- Implement request batching
- Cache frequent operations
- Background processing for long-running tasks
- Progress reporting for UI feedback

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Track MCP server response times
- Monitor error rates
- Log performance metrics
- Usage statistics

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for multiple MCP servers
2. Advanced document processing workflows
3. Custom MCP node development
4. Integration with other Obsidian plugins

## Rollout Strategy

1. Internal testing with development team
2. Limited beta release to select users
3. Gradual rollout to all users
4. Monitor and address feedback

## Success Metrics

- Reduced processing time for document operations
- Improved reliability of file operations
- Positive user feedback on new features
- Low error rates in production
