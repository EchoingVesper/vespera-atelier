# Vespera Scriptorium Implementation Documentation

This directory contains implementation details and guidelines for the Vespera Scriptorium project.

## Contents

- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md) - Detailed plan for implementing Vespera Scriptorium

## Implementation Overview

The implementation of Vespera Scriptorium follows a structured approach, with features being developed in a prioritized order according to the implementation plan. This now includes the ongoing refactoring to an n8n-inspired processing pipeline, which introduces a new modular and flexible architecture for document processing.

### Development Approach

- **Incremental Development**: Features are implemented incrementally, with each milestone building on the previous one
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before or alongside implementation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and build processes ensure code quality
- **Documentation**: Code and features are documented as they are developed

### Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: The primary programming language
- **Obsidian API**: For integration with Obsidian
- **LLM APIs**: For interfacing with language models
- **Jest/Vitest**: For testing
- **ESBuild**: For building the plugin

### Code Organization

- **Modular Structure**: Code is organized into modules with clear responsibilities
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data access are separated
- **Interface-Based Design**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Configuration Management**: Settings and configuration are centralized

### Implementation Priorities

The implementation priorities have been updated to reflect the ongoing n8n-inspired processing pipeline refactor:

1. **Core Pipeline Infrastructure**: Establishing the basic structure for the n8n-inspired pipeline, including queue management and orchestration.
2. **Essential Pipeline Nodes**: Implementing core processing nodes such as Ingestion, Classification, Extraction, and Output.
3. **LLM Integration**: Integrating LLM calls as distinct, configurable nodes within the pipeline.
4. **Configuration and Persistence**: Developing robust configuration management for pipeline parameters and persistence mechanisms for processing state.
5. **User Interface for Monitoring**: Implementing UI components for monitoring pipeline progress and reviewing results.
6. **Advanced Pipeline Features**: Adding features like error handling, retry mechanisms, and support for custom nodes.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Write unit tests for all functionality
- Handle errors appropriately

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch for your feature or fix
2. Implement the changes with appropriate tests
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description
5. Address any review comments
6. Merge once approved

### Version Control

- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain a changelog
- Tag releases appropriately
