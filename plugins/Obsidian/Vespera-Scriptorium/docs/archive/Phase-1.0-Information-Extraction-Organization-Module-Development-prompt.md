# Phase 1.0 Information Extraction and Organization Module Development

**Objective:**
Execute the next high-priority development task for the Phase 1.0 Information Extraction and Organization Module (hereafter "the Module"), encompassing task identification, TypeScript-based implementation, comprehensive documentation, and meticulous version control.

**Context:**

* **Project Phase:** `1.0`
* **Module Focus:** `Information Extraction and Organization Module`
* **Task Tracking Location:** Directory [`docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/`](docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/)
* **Git Branch:** `1.0-trail` (Confirm this is the active development branch for Phase 1.0; adapt if project conventions dictate a different branch).

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify Next Task:**
    a.  Access the Task Tracking Location: [`docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/`](docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/).
    b.  Scan files within this directory (e.g., `README.md`, `*.md` files within feature subdirectories like [`docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/features/Workflow Orchestrator/README.md`](docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/features/Workflow%20Orchestrator/README.md:1)) for task lists. Tasks are typically itemized, potentially with checkboxes (e.g., `- [ ] Task description` in Markdown).
    c.  Determine the "next most important task": This is the first uncompleted task item encountered. An uncompleted task is one not explicitly marked as complete (e.g., an unchecked checkbox `[ ]`).
    d.  Prioritization:
        i.  If multiple task files or sections within files exist, process them based on explicit priority indicators (e.g., "High Priority", numerical ordering) or by the order defined in the main `README.md` for the module or phase.
        ii. Within a file or section, the "next most important task" is the first uncompleted task from the top.
    e.  Log the full description and source (file path and line number) of the identified task for logging and subsequent reporting.

2. **Plan Implementation:**
    a.  Thoroughly analyze the requirements of the identified task. Tasks for this Module typically involve TypeScript code development related to information ingestion, extraction (potentially including LLM interactions via [`src/LLMClient.ts`](src/LLMClient.ts:1)), data processing, classification, output generation, or workflow orchestration (see components in [`src/`](src/)).
    b.  Formulate a detailed implementation plan:
        i.  Outline anticipated code changes: specify functions, classes, and methods to be added or modified.
        ii. Identify new files/modules to be created or existing ones to be modified (e.g., within [`src/ingestion/`](src/ingestion/), [`src/workflow-orchestrator/`](src/workflow-orchestrator/), [`src/processing/`](src/processing/)).
        iii. Define a specific testing strategy, including unit tests for new logic.

3. **Implement Task:**
    a.  Execute the implementation plan. Write new TypeScript code or modify existing code within the project's established structure for the Module (primarily within the [`src/`](src/)).
    b.  Adhere strictly to all project-defined coding standards (e.g., `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/types), style guides (as enforced by ESLint, see [`eslint.config.js`](eslint.config.js:1)), and established best practices (SOLID principles, error handling).
    c.  Develop comprehensive unit tests for all new or modified functionality using the project's testing framework (likely Playwright/Vitest, see [`playwright.config.ts`](playwright.config.ts:1) and `tests/` directory). Ensure all tests (both new and pre-existing in files like [`tests/unit/LLMClient.spec.ts`](tests/unit/LLMClient.spec.ts:1)) pass successfully.
    d.  Utilize available MCP server tools (as defined in [`e:/My Work/Programming/Plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium/.roo/rules/rules.md`](./.roo/rules/rules.md:1)) for development, debugging, testing, and code quality assurance where applicable.
    e.  Employ available operational modes (e.g., 'Code', 'Architect', 'Debug') if they offer specialized assistance, constraints, or context relevant to the Module.

4. **Update Documentation (Iteratively and Post-Implementation):**
    a.  As you proceed with implementation and upon its completion, update all relevant documentation:
        i.  In the task tracking file(s) (identified in Step 1b), accurately mark the implemented task as complete (e.g., change `[ ]` to `[x]`).
        ii. Update or add comprehensive code comments (JSDoc style) and docstrings in all TypeScript source code files (`*.ts`) that were created or modified.
        iii. If changes introduce new features, significantly alter existing behavior, or impact the Module's architecture, update corresponding `README.md` files (e.g., [`docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/features/README.md`](docs/tracking/phase-1.0-information-extraction-organization-module/features/README.md:1)), design documents, or user guides (e.g., in [`docs/user-guide/`](docs/user-guide/)).

5. **Final Review and Verification:**
    a.  Conduct a thorough self-review of all code changes and documentation updates to ensure accuracy, completeness, and quality.
    b.  Verify that the implementation fully addresses all stated requirements of the identified task.
    c.  Confirm that all unit tests pass and the Module is in a stable, functional state.

6. **Version Control and Push to GitHub:**
    a.  Verify that the current Git branch is `1.0-trail`. If not, switch to this branch.
    b.  Adhere to the Pre-Commit Staging Mandate: `git add .` (executed from the repository root: `e:/My Work/Programming/Plugins/Obsidian/Vespera-Scriptorium/`). This is mandated by the [`Standardized Git Workflow Protocol`](./.roo/rules/git-workflow-protocol.md:1).
    c.  Commit the staged changes. The commit message must be clear, concise, and descriptive, adhering to Conventional Commits. A recommended format is: `feat(scope): Brief summary of new feature` or `fix(scope): Brief summary of bug fix`, where `scope` refers to the specific module component (e.g., `ingestion`, `extraction`, `workflowOrchestrator`). Include a reference to the task, e.g., "Implements: [task description snippet]".
    d.  Push the commit(s) to the `origin` remote on the `1.0-trail` branch (e.g., `git push origin 1.0-trail`). Ensure adherence to the Comprehensive Push Mandate from the [`Standardized Git Workflow Protocol`](./.roo/rules/git-workflow-protocol.md:1).

**Key Requirements and Success Criteria:**

* **Accuracy:** Precisely identify and interpret task requirements from project documentation.
* **Code Quality:** Produce robust, efficient, and maintainable TypeScript code, following established project patterns.
* **Testing:** Ensure thorough unit testing with adequate coverage for all changes.
* **Documentation:** Maintain clear, complete, and up-to-date technical and user-facing documentation.
* **Version Control:** Follow specified Git procedures meticulously as per [`git-workflow-protocol.md`](./.roo/rules/git-workflow-protocol.md:1).
* **Autonomy:** Complete the task cycle independently unless a genuine blocker is encountered.

**Error Handling Protocol:**

* If any step cannot be completed due to critical ambiguity in instructions, missing essential information/credentials, or an unrecoverable error, halt execution at that point.
* Clearly document:
    1. The step where the process was halted.
    2. The specific issue or blocker encountered.
    3. The current state of any modified files or system configurations.
* Await further instructions. Do not make assumptions on critical, undefined aspects of the task.
