2. [Compression Strategies](./02-compression.md)
3. [Caching Policies](./03-caching.md)
4. [Testing Storage Solutions](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current storage implementation relies on file system operations and in-memory storage, which has limitations for large documents and long-term storage. The enhanced storage solutions will:

1. Implement a lightweight database for chunk and document storage
2. Add compression strategies to reduce storage requirements
3. Develop intelligent caching policies for performance optimization
4. Include comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and performance

By implementing these enhancements, we can provide a storage system that balances performance, reliability, and resource usage, while scaling to handle large document collections.

## Implementation Timeline

These enhancements should take approximately 2-3 weeks to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these enhancements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the immediate fixes and short-term improvements
2. Knowledge of database systems suitable for Obsidian plugins
3. Understanding of compression algorithms and their trade-offs
4. Experience with caching strategies and their implementation
