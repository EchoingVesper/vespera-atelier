# Recovery System

This section provides detailed instructions for implementing an advanced recovery system in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These enhancements will ensure that processing can be resumed after interruptions or errors without data loss.

2. [Automatic Recovery](./02-auto-recovery.md)
3. [User Recovery Interface](./03-user-interface.md)
4. [Testing Recovery System](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current implementation lacks robust recovery mechanisms, which can lead to lost work when errors occur or processing is interrupted. The enhanced recovery system will:

1. Implement a comprehensive checkpointing system to save progress at key points
2. Add automatic recovery capabilities to resume processing after crashes
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for managing and initiating recovery
4. Include thorough testing to ensure reliability in various error scenarios

By implementing these enhancements, we can ensure that users' work is preserved even when errors occur, significantly improving the reliability and user experience of the plugin.

## Implementation Timeline

These enhancements should take approximately 1-2 weeks to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these enhancements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the immediate fixes and short-term improvements
2. A good understanding of state management and persistence
3. Experience with fault-tolerant system design
4. Familiarity with Obsidian's UI APIs for creating recovery interfaces
