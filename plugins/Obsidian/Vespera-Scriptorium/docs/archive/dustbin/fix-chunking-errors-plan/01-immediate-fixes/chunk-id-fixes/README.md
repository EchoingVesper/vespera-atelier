# Chunk ID Fixes

This section provides detailed instructions for fixing the chunk ID issues in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These fixes address the "Chunk ID missing during sorting" warnings observed in the logs.

4. [Testing Chunk ID Fixes](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The error logs show multiple instances of "Chunk ID missing during sorting, using default order" warnings. This indicates that chunks are being processed without proper ID assignment, which leads to inefficient sorting and potential memory issues.

The fixes in this section will ensure that:

1. All chunks receive a unique ID during the chunking process
2. The `sortChunksByPosition` function can handle missing IDs gracefully
3. Default IDs are assigned in a consistent manner when necessary

By implementing these fixes, we can prevent the cascade of issues that lead to memory errors during document assembly.

## Implementation Timeline

These fixes should take approximately 2-4 hours to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these fixes, ensure you have:

1. A local development environment set up for the Vespera Scriptorium plugin
2. Understanding of TypeScript and the Obsidian plugin API
3. Access to the plugin's codebase, particularly the files containing the chunking and sorting logic
