# Diagnostics Improvements

This section provides detailed instructions for implementing diagnostics tools in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These improvements will help identify and debug memory issues and other problems during document processing.

1. [Memory Usage Logging](./01-memory-logging.md)
2. [Performance Metrics Collection](./02-performance-metrics.md)
3. [Diagnostic Dashboard](./03-dashboard.md)
4. [Testing Diagnostics](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current implementation lacks comprehensive diagnostics and reporting capabilities, making it difficult to identify the root causes of memory issues. The diagnostics improvements will:

1. Add detailed memory usage logging at key points
2. Collect and report performance metrics
3. Provide a diagnostic dashboard for users and developers
4. Include tools for debugging and monitoring

By implementing these improvements, we can gain better visibility into the plugin's operation and more quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Implementation Timeline

These improvements should take approximately 1-2 days to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these improvements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the immediate fixes
2. A good understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript memory management
3. Familiarity with Obsidian's UI APIs for creating the dashboard
