# Chunking Process Improvements

This section provides detailed instructions for refactoring the chunking process in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. These improvements build upon the immediate fixes and provide a more robust solution for document chunking.

3. [Chunk Metadata Improvements](./03-metadata.md)
4. [Testing Chunking Process](./04-testing.md)

## Overview

The current chunking process appears to have issues with ID assignment and metadata tracking, which leads to memory problems during document assembly. This section outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the chunking process to make it more robust and efficient.

The improvements in this section will:

1. Refactor the chunking process for better maintainability and performance
2. Implement robust ID generation for all chunks
3. Enhance chunk metadata to facilitate better sorting and assembly
4. Add comprehensive testing for the chunking process

By implementing these improvements, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of memory issues and improve the overall stability of the plugin.

## Implementation Timeline

These improvements should take approximately 1-2 days to implement and test.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing these improvements, ensure you have:

1. Completed the immediate fixes, particularly the chunk ID fixes
2. A good understanding of the current chunking implementation
3. Familiarity with text processing and splitting algorithms
