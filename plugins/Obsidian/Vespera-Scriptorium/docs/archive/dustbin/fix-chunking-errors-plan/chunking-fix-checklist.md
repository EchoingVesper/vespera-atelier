# Vespera Scriptorium Chunking Errors Fix Checklist

This checklist tracks progress on implementing fixes for chunking errors in the Vespera Scriptorium plugin. The plan is divided into three phases with specific tasks for each phase.

## Problem Summary
- [ ] Missing chunk IDs during sorting
- [ ] Inefficient memory management during document assembly
- [ ] No error handling for memory-intensive operations
- [ ] Accumulation of chunked data without proper cleanup

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-2 days)
- [ ] Complete all tasks in [Immediate Fixes Checklist](./01-immediate-fixes/immediate-fixes-checklist.md)

### Phase 2: Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Complete all tasks in [Short-term Improvements Checklist](./02-short-term-improvements/short-term-improvements-checklist.md)

### Phase 3: Long-term Enhancements (1-2 months)
- [ ] Complete all tasks in [Long-term Enhancements Checklist](./03-long-term-enhancements/long-term-enhancements-checklist.md)

## Testing Validation

After implementing each phase:
- [ ] Process a large document (>10 pages)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during processing
- [ ] Verify proper chunk ID assignment
- [ ] Test recovery from simulated errors

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Immediate Fixes - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Phase 2: Short-term Improvements - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Phase 3: Long-term Enhancements - NOT STARTED
