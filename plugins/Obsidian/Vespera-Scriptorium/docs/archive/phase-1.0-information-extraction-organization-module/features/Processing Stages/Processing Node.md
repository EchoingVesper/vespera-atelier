# Processing Node

**Architectural Role:** The Processing Node is responsible for taking individual document chunks and applying a specific processing step to them. This could involve various operations such as analysis, transformation, or preparation for further stages. It receives input from the Input Node (or potentially a queue) and produces output that is passed to the next node in the workflow.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `processChunk` method within the `ProcessingOrchestrator` class (`src/robust-processing/ProcessingOrchestrator.ts`) appears to be the primary implementation of the Processing Node's logic for individual chunks.

*   **Implementation:** The `processChunk` method handles the processing of a single `DocumentChunk`. It includes logic for calculating timeouts, creating prompts, interacting with the LLM client, handling errors (including timeouts and rate limits), retrying failed attempts with exponential backoff, and updating the processing checkpoint.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Processing Node" is not a distinct class or module but rather a method within the `ProcessingOrchestrator`. While the core logic exists, formalizing it as a dedicated component would improve modularity and adherence to the decomposed architecture.
    *   The `processChunk` method currently tightly couples the processing logic with LLM interaction (`this.llmClient.generateCompletion`). A true "Processing Node" should be more abstract and capable of performing various types of processing (not just LLM calls), potentially by accepting different processing functions or strategies.
    *   The error handling and retry logic are embedded within `processChunk`. While functional, extracting this into a dedicated "Error Handling/Recovery" component (as per the architectural decomposition) would improve separation of concerns.
    *   The concept of different "types" of processing nodes (beyond just LLM calls) is not explicitly represented.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Create a dedicated module/class for the "Processing Node". (`src/robust-processing/ProcessingNode.ts` created).
*   [x] Decouple the core processing logic from direct LLM client interaction. (Achieved by making `ProcessingNode` accept a generic `processingFunction`).
*   [x] Design the Processing Node to be adaptable to different processing tasks (e.g., classification, extraction, analysis) via configurable processing functions or strategies. (Implemented via generic `ProcessingFunction` and `ProcessingNodeOptions`).
*   [ ] Integrate with the planned "Error Handling/Recovery" components for centralized error management and retries. (Basic error handling in place; full integration pending Error Handling component).
*   [x] Define clear interfaces for input (a `DocumentChunk`) and output (a `ChunkResult` or similar). (`DocumentChunk` as input, `ChunkResult` as output, and `ProcessingFunction` type defined in `ProcessingNode.ts`).
*   [x] Document the Processing Node's role, different potential types, and implementation clearly. (JSDoc comments in `ProcessingNode.ts` are comprehensive and reflect recent fixes).
