# Classification Rules/Models

**Architectural Role:** Classification Rules/Models represent the knowledge base or logic used by the Classifier Engine to perform document classification. This could include predefined rules, machine learning models, taxonomies, or other data structures that map document characteristics to classification labels.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of "Classification Rules/Models" as a distinct component.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated module or data structure that defines the rules, models, or knowledge base for document classification.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Classification Rules/Models" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for defining, storing, and managing classification logic is missing.
    *   Integration with the Classifier Engine to utilize these rules/models is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design a format or structure for defining classification rules or models.
*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/component for managing "Classification Rules/Models".
*   [ ] Consider how these rules/models will be loaded and made available to the Classifier Engine.
*   [ ] Document the format for classification rules/models and the implementation of their management.
