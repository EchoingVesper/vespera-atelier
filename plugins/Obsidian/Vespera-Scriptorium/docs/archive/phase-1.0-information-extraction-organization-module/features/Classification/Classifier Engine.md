# Classifier Engine

**Architectural Role:** The Classifier Engine is responsible for analyzing document content or metadata to assign categories, tags, or other classification labels. It utilizes classification rules or models to perform this task and provides the classification results to subsequent processing stages or for metadata updates.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of a "Classifier Engine" component.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated class or module specifically responsible for performing document classification based on predefined rules or models.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Classifier Engine" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for applying classification logic to document content or metadata is missing.
    *   Integration with potential classification rules, models, or external classification services is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Classifier Engine".
*   [ ] Define how the Classifier Engine receives document content or metadata for classification.
*   [ ] Implement logic for applying classification rules or models.
*   [ ] Define the output format for classification results.
*   [ ] Integrate the Classifier Engine with the workflow and potentially the Metadata Updater.
*   [ ] Document the Classifier Engine's role, configuration, and implementation details.
