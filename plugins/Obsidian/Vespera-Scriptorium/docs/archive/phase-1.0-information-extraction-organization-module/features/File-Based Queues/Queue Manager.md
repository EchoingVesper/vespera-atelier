# Queue Manager

**Architectural Role:** The Queue Manager is responsible for the overall administration and coordination of the file-based queues. This includes creating and managing different queues, monitoring their status, handling queue-level operations (like clearing or listing queues), and potentially coordinating between Queue Readers and Writers.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of a "Queue Manager" component that manages file-based queues.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated class or module responsible for creating, managing, or monitoring file-based queues. The concept of queues as described in the architectural decomposition does not appear to be implemented.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Queue Manager" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A system for defining, creating, and managing different file-based queues is missing.
    *   Functionality for monitoring queue status, size, or processing rate is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Queue Manager".
*   [ ] Define mechanisms for creating, accessing, and managing different file-based queues.
*   [ ] Implement functionality for monitoring queue status and providing administrative operations.
*   [ ] Integrate the Queue Manager with the persistence layer and potentially the Workflow Orchestrator.
*   [ ] Document the Queue Manager's role, responsibilities, and API.
