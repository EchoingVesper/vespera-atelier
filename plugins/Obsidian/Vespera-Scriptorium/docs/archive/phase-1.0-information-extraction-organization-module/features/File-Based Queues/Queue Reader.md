# Queue Reader

**Architectural Role:** The Queue Reader is responsible for consuming items from the file-based queues. It interacts with the persistence layer to retrieve the next available item(s) from a queue, typically in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner. It might also handle marking items as being processed or completed.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there is no explicit implementation of a "Queue Reader" component that consumes items from file-based queues.

*   **Implementation:** There is no dedicated class or module responsible for reading items from file-based queues. The concept of reading from a queue as described in the architectural decomposition does not appear to be implemented.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Queue Reader" component is not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A mechanism for reading items from file-based queues in a defined order is missing.
    *   Functionality for managing the state of items being read (e.g., marking as in-progress) is not present.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Queue Reader".
*   [ ] Define how the Queue Reader interacts with the persistence layer to retrieve queue items.
*   [ ] Implement logic for reading items based on queue order (e.g., FIFO).
*   [ ] Include mechanisms for handling item state (e.g., marking as read or processed).
*   [ ] Document the Queue Reader's role, responsibilities, and API.
