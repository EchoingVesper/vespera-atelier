# Output Destination Manager

**Architectural Role:** The Output Destination Manager is responsible for handling different targets where the final processed output can be saved. This could include writing to files within the Obsidian vault (the current functionality), writing to external file paths, sending to APIs, or integrating with other services. It abstracts the details of interacting with various output destinations.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `saveOutput` method within the `OutputManager` class (`src/robust-processing/OutputManager.ts`) handles writing to the Obsidian vault, which is one type of output destination.

*   **Implementation:** The `saveOutput` method uses the `this.app.vault.adapter.write` method to save the generated content to a specified path within the Obsidian vault. This directly implements writing to one type of destination.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   A dedicated "Output Destination Manager" component that can handle multiple types of output destinations is not implemented.
    *   The current implementation is tightly coupled to the Obsidian vault adapter.
    *   Mechanisms for configuring and selecting different output destinations are not present.
    *   Logic for handling potential errors or specific requirements of different output destinations is not centralized.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Output Destination Manager".
*   [ ] Define an interface for different output destinations.
*   [ ] Implement concrete classes for various output destinations (e.g., Obsidian vault, local file system, external service API).
*   [ ] Implement logic within the Output Destination Manager for selecting and writing to the appropriate destination based on configuration.
*   [ ] Ensure the Output Writer integrates with the Output Destination Manager to handle saving to different targets.
*   [ ] Document the Output Destination Manager's role, supported destinations, and implementation details.
