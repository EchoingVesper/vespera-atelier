# Context Window Management

**Architectural Role:** Context Window Management is responsible for handling the limitations imposed by LLM context windows. This includes determining the appropriate chunk size and overlap during chunking, managing the context provided to the LLM for each chunk (e.g., including preceding/following text), and potentially implementing strategies for handling documents that exceed the maximum context window even after chunking.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `src/robust-processing/AdaptiveChunker.ts` and `src/robust-processing/ContextWindowDetector.ts` files contain functionality related to context window management.

*   **Implementation:** The `AdaptiveChunker` uses the context window size to calculate optimal chunk size and overlap and includes preceding/following context in chunk metadata. The `ContextWindowDetector` (though not read yet) is likely responsible for determining the context window size of different models.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   While chunking and context inclusion are handled, a dedicated, centralized "Context Window Manager" component that orchestrates all aspects of context handling across the workflow is not explicitly defined.
    *   Strategies for handling documents that are too large even after chunking (e.g., summarization before processing, hierarchical processing) are not clearly implemented or defined within a dedicated component.
    *   Integration with the "LLM Client Interface" to obtain model-specific context window sizes is necessary.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Context Window Management" component.
*   [ ] Define how the component interacts with the chunking process and the LLM Client Interface to manage context.
*   [ ] Implement strategies for handling documents that exceed the maximum context window.
*   [ ] Ensure accurate determination of model-specific context window sizes.
*   [ ] Document the Context Window Management strategies and implementation details.
