# Node Executor

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Last Updated**: May 20, 2025
- **Architectural Role**: Executes individual nodes/tasks within a workflow by dispatching them to registered handlers based on node type.

## Development Log

- **May 20, 2025**: Basic class structure `NodeExecutor.ts` created in `src/workflow-orchestrator/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
- **May 20, 2025**:
    - Defined `IWorkflowNodeHandler` interface and `NodeExecutionError` class in `src/workflow-orchestrator/types.ts`.
    - Refactored `NodeExecutor.ts`:
        - Implemented `INodeExecutor` interface with methods `registerNodeHandler`, `unregisterNodeHandler`, and `executeNode`.
        - `NodeExecutor` class now uses a `Map` to store and retrieve `IWorkflowNodeHandler` instances based on `WorkflowStage.type`.
        - Basic error handling for missing handlers and handler execution errors implemented, returning `NodeExecutionResult`.
    - Created placeholder handlers in `src/workflow-orchestrator/node-handlers/`:
        - `LogMessageHandler.ts`: Logs messages based on stage configuration.
        - `SimpleTaskHandler.ts`: Simulates a generic task execution.

## Checklist for Updates

- [x] Design and implement the `NodeExecutor` class. (Core structure with handler registration and dispatch logic implemented)
- [x] Define a clear interface for workflow nodes (`IWorkflowNode`). (Replaced with `IWorkflowNodeHandler` in `types.ts` for executable logic)
- [x] Implement logic to dynamically execute different types of nodes (e.g., task, decision, LLM call). (Handler registration and basic dispatch implemented. Placeholder handlers created.)
- [x] Handle input and output data for each node. (Basic pass-through of `workflowState.data` to handlers and returning `NodeExecutionResult` implemented.)
- [ ] Integrate with `ErrorHandlingConfigurationIntegration` for node-level error reporting and retries.
- [x] Consider extensibility for adding new node types. (Handler registration mechanism provides extensibility.)
- [ ] Write unit tests for executing various node types and handling their outcomes.
- [ ] Document the node execution process and how to create custom nodes.
