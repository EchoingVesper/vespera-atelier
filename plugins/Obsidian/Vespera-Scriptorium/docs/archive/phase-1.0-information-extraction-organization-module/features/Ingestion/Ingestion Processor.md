# Ingestion Processor

**Status:** Implemented
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

**Architectural Role:** The Ingestion Processor is the core component of the ingestion system. It receives requests to ingest documents (from the File Watcher or Manual Ingestion Trigger), coordinates the necessary steps to prepare the document for processing (e.g., reading, initial parsing, metadata extraction), and initiates the processing workflow, potentially by adding the document or its parts to a queue.

**Codebase Comparison Findings (Pre-Scaffolding):**

Based on the examination of the `src/` directory, there was no explicit implementation of a dedicated "Ingestion Processor" component. The initial steps of processing a document seemed to be handled within the `ProcessingOrchestrator` or related components, rather than a distinct ingestion pipeline.

*   **Implementation (Pre-Scaffolding):** There was no dedicated class or module responsible for orchestrating the steps involved in ingesting a document from its raw form into a state ready for the main processing workflow. The logic for reading files and initial processing was likely embedded elsewhere.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates (Pre-Scaffolding):**
    *   The "Ingestion Processor" component was not implemented in the current codebase.
    *   A centralized component for managing the entire ingestion pipeline, from trigger to initiating the processing workflow, was missing.
    *   The responsibilities of reading different file types and performing initial parsing were not clearly defined within a dedicated ingestion component.

**Development Log:**
*   **2025-05-20:** Basic class structure `IngestionProcessor.ts` created in `src/ingestion/`. Status set to Scaffolded.
*   **2025-05-20:** Implemented full functionality including file validation, content reading, metadata extraction, and workflow initiation. Status updated to Implemented.

**Implementation Details:**

The Ingestion Processor has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline:**
   * Validates file existence and accessibility
   * Reads file content using appropriate methods based on environment
   * Extracts metadata using the Metadata Extractor
   * Prepares document objects for further processing

2. **Environment Adaptability:**
   * Works in both Obsidian environment and standalone Node.js environment
   * Uses appropriate APIs based on the detected environment

3. **Workflow Integration:**
   * Integrates with queue-based processing for asynchronous operations
   * Supports direct workflow execution for synchronous processing
   * Configurable default workflow and queue settings

4. **Batch Processing:**
   * Supports processing multiple files in sequence
   * Provides detailed success/failure reporting for batch operations
   * Handles errors gracefully without stopping the entire batch

5. **Error Handling:**
   * Robust error handling for file access issues
   * Detailed error reporting with specific error types
   * Graceful failure handling with informative messages

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [x] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Ingestion Processor". (`src/ingestion/IngestionProcessor.ts` created)
*   [x] Define the steps involved in the ingestion pipeline (reading, parsing, metadata extraction).
*   [x] Implement logic for coordinating these steps and handling different file types.
*   [x] Define how the Ingestion Processor initiates the main processing workflow (e.g., by interacting with the Workflow Execution Engine or adding items to a queue).
*   [x] Document the Ingestion Processor's role, pipeline steps, and implementation details.
