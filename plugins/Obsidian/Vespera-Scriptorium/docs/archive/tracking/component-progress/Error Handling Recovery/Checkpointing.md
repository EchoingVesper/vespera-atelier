# Checkpointing

**Architectural Role:** Checkpointing is a mechanism within the error handling and recovery system that involves periodically saving the state of an ongoing workflow execution to persistent storage. This allows the workflow to be resumed from the last saved checkpoint in case of failures or interruptions, preventing the need to restart the entire process from the beginning.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `PersistenceManager` class in `src/robust-processing/PersistenceManager.ts` and the `ProcessingOrchestrator` class in `src/robust-processing/ProcessingOrchestrator.ts` implement checkpointing functionality.

*   **Implementation:** The `PersistenceManager` handles the saving and loading of `ProcessingCheckpoint` objects to and from disk. The `ProcessingOrchestrator` creates and updates these checkpoints during document processing, saving the state of completed, pending, and failed chunks, along with partial results and processing statistics. The `resumeProcessing` method in `ProcessingOrchestrator` utilizes the saved checkpoint to restart processing from the last known state.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The checkpointing logic is currently tied to the specific `ProcessingCheckpoint` structure used by the `ProcessingOrchestrator`. A more generalized checkpointing mechanism that can save the state of any workflow being executed by the Workflow Execution Engine might be needed for a more flexible workflow system.
    *   The checkpointing interval and saving logic are embedded within the `ProcessingOrchestrator`. Centralizing this configuration and control within the "Recovery Manager" or a dedicated "Checkpoint Manager" could improve modularity.
    *   Mechanisms for managing multiple checkpoints for a single workflow or handling different versions of checkpoints are not explicitly detailed.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design a more generalized checkpointing mechanism that can save the state of arbitrary workflows.
*   [ ] Consider creating a dedicated "Checkpoint Manager" component to handle the creation, saving, loading, and management of checkpoints.
*   [ ] Ensure the checkpointing mechanism integrates with the "Persistence Manager" for storage and the "Recovery Manager" for recovery.
*   [ ] Document the checkpointing process, the structure of checkpoint data, and implementation details.
