# Retry Mechanism

**Architectural Role:** The Retry Mechanism is responsible for automatically re-attempting failed operations that are considered transient or potentially recoverable. It typically employs strategies like exponential backoff with jitter to avoid overwhelming the system or external services during temporary issues.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

Retry logic is implemented in both the `LLMClient` and the `ProcessingOrchestrator` classes.

*   **Implementation:** The `LLMClient` has a `withRetry` method that wraps LLM calls and retries them a configured number of times with exponential backoff. The `ProcessingOrchestrator`'s `processChunk` method also includes retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter for specific error types (timeout, rate limit, etc.).
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The "Retry Mechanism" is not a distinct, centralized component. Retry logic is duplicated in `LLMClient` and `ProcessingOrchestrator`.
    *   A consistent and standardized mechanism for applying retry strategies to any retryable operation within the workflow is missing.
    *   The configuration and control of retry behavior are spread across different components.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Design and implement a dedicated module/class for the "Retry Mechanism".
*   [ ] Define a generic interface for retryable operations.
*   [ ] Implement various retry strategies (e.g., exponential backoff, fixed delay, with jitter).
*   [ ] Consolidate retry logic from `LLMClient` and `ProcessingOrchestrator` into the dedicated Retry Mechanism component.
*   [ ] Ensure the Error Handler or Recovery Manager can utilize the Retry Mechanism to re-attempt failed operations.
*   [ ] Document the Retry Mechanism's role, supported strategies, and implementation details.
