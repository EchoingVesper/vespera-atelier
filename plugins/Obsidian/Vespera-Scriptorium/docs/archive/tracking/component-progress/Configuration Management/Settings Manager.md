# Settings Manager

**Architectural Role:** The Settings Manager is responsible for providing access to the plugin's configuration settings to other components. It acts as a central point for retrieving the current settings and potentially updating them.

**Codebase Comparison Findings:**

The `SettingsManager` class in `src/SettingsManager.ts` implements the core functionality for managing and providing access to settings.

*   **Implementation:** The `SettingsManager` class loads settings from a file (acting as a Configuration Loader), stores them internally, and provides a `getSettings` method to access the current configuration. It also has an `updateSettings` method to modify and save settings.
*   **Discrepancies/Required Updates:**
    *   The `SettingsManager` currently combines the responsibilities of loading, storing, and providing access to settings. While functional, separating the loading logic into a dedicated "Configuration Loader" would align better with the decomposed architecture.
    *   The `SettingsManager` does not explicitly integrate with a "Configuration Validator" to ensure that updated settings are valid before saving.
    *   The management of saved prompts is also included in this class, which could potentially be a separate concern.

**Checklist for Updates:**

*   [ ] Refactor `SettingsManager` to focus primarily on storing and providing access to settings.
*   [ ] Ensure `SettingsManager` utilizes a dedicated "Configuration Loader" to load settings.
*   [ ] Integrate `SettingsManager` with a "Configuration Validator" to validate settings before they are applied or saved.
*   [ ] Consider separating the management of saved prompts into a distinct component.
*   [ ] Document the Settings Manager's role, how to access settings, and its implementation details.
