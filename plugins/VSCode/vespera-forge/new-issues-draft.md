# New GitHub Issues to Create

## Issue 1: Complete rust-file-ops Integration
**Title:** Complete rust-file-ops integration to replace default file tools
**Labels:** integration, performance, rust, vs-code-extension
**Related to:** #43

### Description
The rust-file-ops security wrapper has been created but the actual Rust binary integration is incomplete. Need to finish the integration to replace default read/write/edit tools with the high-performance Rust implementation.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Security wrapper created (`src/rust-file-ops/security-wrapper.ts`)
- ‚ùå Rust binary not built/integrated
- ‚ùå Build process not configured
- ‚ùå Tool replacement not active

### Tasks
- [ ] Build rust-file-ops binary
- [ ] Configure build process in package.json
- [ ] Wire up binary to security wrapper
- [ ] Replace default file tools with Rust implementation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test file operations at scale

## Issue 2: Implement Context Foldout UI Component
**Title:** Implement collapsible context foldout with visual separation
**Labels:** enhancement, ui-ux, vs-code-extension, high-priority
**Related to:** #49, #50, #41, #42

### Description
While we've added the Discord-like multi-server interface, the original context display issues remain partially unresolved. Need to implement a proper collapsible context foldout that visually separates file context from agent responses.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Discord-like server/channel interface implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Context display may be mixed with Discord UI
- ‚ùå Dedicated context foldout not implemented
- ‚ùå Visual separation needs improvement

### Tasks
- [ ] Design context foldout component
- [ ] Implement collapsible/expandable UI
- [ ] Add persistent collapse state
- [ ] Ensure visual separation from agent responses
- [ ] Integrate with existing Discord-like UI
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for toggle

## Issue 3: Configure Claude Code Tool Overrides
**Title:** Disable default Claude Code tools using SDK methods
**Labels:** configuration, sdk, tooling, vs-code-extension
**Related to:** #44

### Description
Need to properly configure Claude Code to disable default tools and use our custom implementations instead. This requires SDK-specific configuration that may not be fully implemented.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Custom tool implementations exist
- ‚ùì Tool override configuration status unknown
- ‚ùå Default tools may still be active

### Tasks
- [ ] Research Claude Code SDK tool override methods
- [ ] Implement tool disable configuration
- [ ] Verify custom tools are being used
- [ ] Add configuration UI for tool selection
- [ ] Document tool override process

## Issue 4: Verify and Complete Bindery Runtime Integration
**Title:** Verify Bindery integration and complete runtime setup
**Labels:** integration, investigation, high-priority
**Related to:** #51

### Description
The Bindery service layer exists with comprehensive security features, but runtime integration needs verification. Need to ensure the Bindery backend is properly connected and functional.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Bindery service layer implemented
- ‚úÖ Security wrapper and JSON-RPC complete
- ‚ùì Runtime integration status unknown
- ‚ùì Backend connection verification needed

### Tasks
- [ ] Verify Bindery backend is accessible
- [ ] Test JSON-RPC communication
- [ ] Validate security features in runtime
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create Bindery status indicator
- [ ] Document setup requirements

# PR Description Update

## PR Title
feat: Major TypeScript cleanup and architecture improvements

## Description
This PR represents a comprehensive cleanup and architectural improvement of the Vespera Forge VS Code extension, addressing all TypeScript errors and implementing significant enhancements.

### üéØ Achievements
- **TypeScript Errors:** Reduced from 431 ‚Üí 0 errors (100% cleanup)
- **Code Organization:** Refactored 3 large files (3,000+ lines) into 14 focused modules
- **Test Coverage:** Added ~4,800 lines of comprehensive tests
- **Performance:** Eliminated all blocking operations in async methods
- **Security:** Type-safe event handling throughout
- **Technical Debt:** Fixed 25 high/medium priority TODOs

### ‚úÖ Closes
- Closes #52 - Chat provider implementations (all providers complete, no TODOs)
- Closes #40 - Session persistence (full implementation with 30-second auto-save)
- Closes #48 - Security & Performance from PR #47 (all feedback addressed)

### üîß Partially Addresses
- Partially addresses #49, #50, #41, #42 - Context UI (Discord-like interface added, foldout pending)
- Partially addresses #51 - Bindery integration (service layer complete, runtime verification needed)

### üìù Follow-up Issues Created
- See #[NEW1] - Complete rust-file-ops integration
- See #[NEW2] - Implement context foldout UI component  
- See #[NEW3] - Configure Claude Code tool overrides
- See #[NEW4] - Verify Bindery runtime integration

### üèóÔ∏è Major Changes

#### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
- Replaced all sync file operations with async
- Fixed type safety in security-critical code

#### Phase 2: Architecture 
- Split PropertyInvestigationTools.ts (1,239 ‚Üí 507 lines)
- Split UnusedPropertyAnalyzer.ts (1,054 ‚Üí 356 lines)
- Split MultiChatStateManager.ts (819 ‚Üí 463 lines)

#### Phase 3: Testing
- 8 new test files with 180+ test cases
- Performance benchmarks and memory leak detection
- Integration and error scenario coverage

#### Phase 4: Cleanup
- Fixed 25 TODOs, deferred 33 low-priority items
- Reduced technical debt by 43%

### üöÄ Discord-like Multi-Server Interface
Added comprehensive multi-server chat interface with:
- Server/channel navigation
- Agent progress tracking per channel
- Task server integration
- Persistent session state

This feature was added during the cleanup process and provides better oversight and logging for agent interactions.
