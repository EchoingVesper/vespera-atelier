Transform Vespera Forge's development process by adopting ideas from GitHub's spec-kit and integrating them with our existing Codex system. This creates a unified knowledge management system for both technical specifications and creative content.

#### Background
After completing our massive TypeScript cleanup (431 → 0 errors), we've learned valuable lessons about the importance of structured planning. GitHub's spec-kit provides excellent patterns for managing technical specifications that align perfectly with Vespera's Codex philosophy.

1. **Structured Planning** - Avoid chaos like the "12 issues at once" situation
2. **Knowledge Preservation** - Decisions documented and searchable
3. **Unified System** - Same tools for creative and technical content
4. **Dogfooding** - Vespera improves by using itself
5. **Transparency** - Clear progress tracking and dependencies

#### Phased Implementation Plan

- [ ] Gather feedback on this proposal
- [ ] Research other spec systems (ADRs, RFCs, etc.)
- [ ] Define spec categories and templates
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept

**Phase 1: Basic Structure (Week 1)**
- [ ] Create spec directory structure
- [ ] Design spec template format
- [ ] Write specs for current outstanding issues
- [ ] Manual spec tracking

**Phase 2: Codex Integration (Week 2-3)**
- [ ] Extend Codex types for technical specs
- [ ] Create spec viewer in VS Code
- [ ] Implement cross-referencing
- [ ] Add search and filtering

**Phase 3: Automation (Week 4-5)**
- [ ] GitHub Actions for validation
- [ ] Auto-status updates
- [ ] Spec compliance testing
- [ ] Progress tracking

**Phase 4: Self-Hosting (Week 6+)**
