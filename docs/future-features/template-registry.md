# Template Registry Feature

## Overview
A curated, web-based template registry where users can discover, preview, and download V2 workflow templates without requiring GitHub knowledge.

## Vision
- **Template Manager GUI**: Built into the main application
- **Search & Discovery**: Browse templates by category, rating, popularity
- **One-Click Install**: Download and instantiate templates directly
- **Community Contributions**: Web-based submission interface for template creators
- **Security & Quality**: Automated scanning and manual review before approval

## User Experience
1. User opens Template Manager in GUI
2. Browses available templates with descriptions, screenshots, ratings
3. Clicks "Use Template" → guided setup with template variables
4. Template instantiated as V2 task tree in their project

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Template browser/manager integrated into main GUI
- **Backend**: Template hosting service with API
- **Storage**: Template files, metadata, ratings, security scan results
- **Pipeline**: Submission → Security scan → Manual review → Approval → Publishing

## Security Requirements
- Automated scanning for malicious commands in task definitions
- Role definition validation (file pattern safety)
- Dependency checking and vulnerability scanning
- Manual review process for complex templates
- Transparent approval workflow

## Challenges
- **Hosting Costs**: Need infrastructure for template storage and web service
- **Moderation**: Manual review process requires dedicated time
- **Security**: Comprehensive scanning to prevent malicious templates
- **Community Building**: Attracting template creators and users

## Potential Solutions
- **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub as storage backend with custom web interface
- **Community Funding**: Patreon/donations to support infrastructure costs
- **Partner Hosting**: Find hosting sponsor interested in supporting open source

## Priority
**Future Enhancement** - Implement after core V2 system is stable and adopted
