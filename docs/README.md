## üéØ Core Concepts

### Projects are Fundamental

Everything in Vespera Atelier exists within a **Project** context. Projects organize content, filter templates, and provide clear boundaries for creative work.

### Dynamic Templates

Templates are JSON5 files that define content types. No hardcoded types means users can create custom templates for any workflow.

### Codex Nesting

Like Scrivener, Codices can contain both content AND children. Chapters can have summaries and contain Scenes. Folders are just Codices with children.

### Template-Driven UI

The UI adapts to templates - field layouts, view modes, and actions all defined in template files.

- ‚úÖ Add implementation warnings to aspirational docs
- ‚úÖ Establish ADR system
- üöß Update documentation hub (in progress)

**Next**: Phase 16 will implement the project-centric refactor

### Recent Phases

- **Phase 14**: LLM provider integration, Chat UI, Navigator improvements
- **Phase 13**: Chat system fixes and template initialization
- **Phase 12**: Chat provider architecture

## üåü Vision

Vespera Atelier aims to create intelligent creative workspaces where:

- **Projects organize everything** - Clear context, reduced clutter
- **Templates define workflows** - User-extensible, project-aware
- **Content nests naturally** - Scrivener-style hierarchies
- **Automation reacts to changes** - Future: Tag-driven workflows

We're building tools that don't just store content, but understand its structure and adapt to creative workflows.
