# Vespera Atelier Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Vespera Atelier monorepo - an ecosystem of intelligent tools for creative professionals, researchers, and knowledge workers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Vespera Atelier implements a revolutionary **Dynamic Automation and Tag-Driven Systems** architecture that transforms static content into reactive, intelligent ecosystems.

### Core Innovation: Reactive Content Workflows

Instead of manual content management, Vespera Codex enables:

- **Tag-driven automation** that responds to content changes
- **LLM-assisted rule creation** from natural language
- **Cross-codex automation chains** that span multiple content types  
- **Real-time reactive updates** across your creative workspace

## 🚀 Quick Start: Experience the Magic

### The 30-Second Demo

1. **Create a scene** with tag `#mood:peaceful`
2. **Link it to music** with "Forest Sounds"  
3. **Change the tag** to `#mood:tense`
4. **Watch the magic**: Music automatically switches to "Battle Drums"

This is just the beginning. The system can automate complex creative workflows across any content type.

### Core Concepts

**🏷️ Tag-Driven Automation**

- Tags become automation triggers (`#mood:peaceful` → `#mood:tense`)
- System responds with intelligent actions (music change, task creation, etc.)
- No manual intervention required

**🤖 LLM-Assisted Setup**  

- Describe automation in natural language: "When Alice gets scared, change the music"
- LLM converts to executable automation rules
- No complex configuration required

**🔗 Cross-Codex Chains**

- Scene completion → Character updates → Task creation → Music changes  
- Cascading automation across different content types
- Intelligent workflow orchestration

**⚡ Real-Time Reactive Content**

- Immediate UI updates when content changes
- Background automation chains execute seamlessly  
- Live feedback shows what's happening and why

## 🏛️ Technical Foundation

### Built on Proven Architecture

The Dynamic Automation system extends Vespera Scriptorium V2's proven architecture:

- **Triple Database System**: SQLite + Chroma + KuzuDB for performance and flexibility
- **MCP Integration**: 14 comprehensive tools via official MCP Python SDK
- **Hierarchical Task Management**: Parent-child relationships and dependencies
- **Role-Based Execution**: Capability restrictions and file pattern matching

### Event-Driven Architecture

```
Content Change → Event Generation → Rule Matching → Action Execution → UI Updates
     ↑              ↓                   ↓              ↓               ↓
Tag Modified → Event Router → Automation Engine → Content Updates → Live Feedback
```

## 🎮 User Experience Magic
