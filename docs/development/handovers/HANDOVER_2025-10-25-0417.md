# Context Handover: 2025-10-25 04:17

## üéØ Current Focus

Documentation cleanup and infrastructure complete. Ready to start **Phase 17: Architectural Refactoring + Codex Editor Implementation** in fresh context window.

## ‚úÖ Just Completed (This Session)

**Major Documentation Overhaul:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced Z.ai scaffold README with grounded, honest project description
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive contributing guides (CONTRIBUTING.md, SETUP.md, AI_STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Built AI Style Guide hook (triggers on .md edits with grounded tone reminder)
- ‚úÖ Created release notes infrastructure (ADR-style with phase subdirectories)
- ‚úÖ Backfilled release notes for Phases 15, 16a, 16b (1,167 lines total)
- ‚úÖ Updated PHASE_17_PLAN.md with chat feature status note

**Commits Created:**
1. `d4fe0e3` - README rewrite and contributing guides (5 files, +759/-108)
2. `cee791f` - AI Style Guide hook and release infrastructure (13 files, +390/-2)
3. `6b14d40` - Release notes for Phases 15, 16a, 16b (5 files, +1,187/-6)

**Key Infrastructure Added:**
- `.claude/hooks/ai-style-reminder.sh` - Triggers before .md edits
- `docs/contributing/` - Complete contributing documentation
- `docs/development/releases/` - Release notes with phase subdirectories
- `RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` - Comprehensive release notes template

## üöß In Progress

**Status**: Documentation phase complete. Ready for implementation work.

**Git State:**
- Branch: `feat/codex-ui-framework`
- **3 unpushed commits** (all documentation)
- Working directory clean
- All changes committed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers / Issues

**None** - Clear path forward to Phase 17 implementation.

**Known Technical Debt** (from hooks):
- 378 TODOs/FIXMEs in codebase
- These are cataloged, not blockers for Phase 17

## üìã Next Up (Priority Order)

### 1. **Push Commits** (First thing!)
```bash
git push origin feat/codex-ui-framework
```

### 2. **Start Phase 17 - Part 1: Architectural Refactoring**

Phase 17 is already planned in detail. **MUST** do Part 1 (refactoring) before Part 2 (editor):

**Part 1: Architectural Refactoring** (2-3 sessions estimated):
1. Refactor database schema (Projects ‚Üí Projects/Contexts split)
2. Implement global registry in `~/.vespera/`
3. Build workspace discovery algorithm
4. Create migration script for Phase 16b ‚Üí Phase 17 data
5. Update UI (Project selector + Context switcher)
6. Update Bindery integration for new schema
7. Test and validate refactoring
8. Update documentation

**Part 2: Editor Implementation** (AFTER Part 1 complete):
- Fix editor display bugs
- Implement template-driven forms
- Complete template filtering
- Add status bar integration

### 3. **Consider Creating Phase 18**

The handover from the previous session suggested possibly splitting Phase 17:
- Phase 17: Architectural Refactoring only
- Phase 18: Editor Implementation

This might be cleaner given the scope, but the current Phase 17 plan is comprehensive and workable.

## üß† Mental Model

**What We Discovered in Phase 16b:**
Phase 16b's "Projects" were actually **organizational contexts** within real-world projects. A game dev project has Story, Research, Code, and Art contexts - all different organizational views using different templates.

**The Fix (Phase 17 Part 1):**
Implement proper three-level hierarchy:
- **Workspace** = VS Code folder (can open at any level)
- **Project** = Real-world creative project (novel, game, research paper)
- **Context** = Organizational view within project (Story, Code, Art, Research)

**Why This Matters:**
- Codices belong to Projects (not Contexts)
- Codices appear in Contexts (many-to-many relationship)
- Same codex can appear in multiple contexts with different organization
- Global registry tracks projects across workspaces

**Architecture Foundation:**
- ADR-015: Workspace/Project/Context Hierarchy
- ADR-016: Global Registry + Workspace Storage

## üìö Key Files for Context

**Read These First (Next Session):**

1. **[PHASE_17_PLAN.md](../phases/PHASE_17_PLAN.md)** ‚≠ê CRITICAL
   - Complete Phase 17 objectives and approach
   - Two-part structure: Refactoring FIRST, then Editor
   - Already incorporates all architectural decisions

2. **[ADR-015: Workspace/Project/Context Hierarchy](../decisions/ADR-015-workspace-project-context-hierarchy.md)** ‚≠ê
   - Three-level architecture design
   - Rationale for refactoring

3. **[ADR-016: Global Registry + Workspace Storage](../decisions/ADR-016-global-registry-storage.md)** ‚≠ê
   - Storage architecture
   - Discovery algorithm
   - Platform-specific paths

4. **[PHASE_16b_COMPLETE.md](../phases/PHASE_16b_COMPLETE.md)**
   - Current state before Phase 17
   - Known issues (editor not displaying)
   - What's broken and needs fixing

5. **[HANDOVER_2025-10-24-1630.md](./HANDOVER_2025-10-24-1630.md)** (Previous handover)
   - Context from previous planning session
   - Subagent orchestration strategy for Part 1

**Code Entry Points:**

For Part 1 (Architectural Refactoring):
- `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/services/ProjectService.ts` - Will become ContextService
- `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/database.rs` - Database schema to refactor
- `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/services/bindery/BinderyService.ts` - API client to update

## üí° Quick Wins

**Documentation Infrastructure:**
- AI Style Guide hook works beautifully (tested today)
- Release notes template is comprehensive
- Contributing guides provide clear onboarding
- README is honest and grounded

**Phase 17 Planning:**
- Plan is thorough and incorporates all architectural insights
- ADRs are complete and provide clear rationale
- Previous handover document has detailed subagent strategy
- No need to re-plan, just execute

**Git Workflow:**
- Clean commit history
- Descriptive commit messages
- All changes staged and committed
- Just need to push

## ‚è∞ Time-Sensitive Items

**None** - This is incremental solo development with flexible timeline.

## üéÅ Bonus Context

**New Tools Available:**
- AI Style Guide hook reminds about grounded tone on .md edits
- Release notes infrastructure for future phase completions
- Contributing guides for future contributors
- Comprehensive documentation navigation via docs/README.md

**Technical Debt Known:**
- 378 TODOs/FIXMEs (cataloged, not urgent)
- Editor not displaying (Phase 17 Part 2 will fix)
- AI Assistant errors (Phase 17 Part 2 will fix)
- Chat feature disabled (low priority, backend exists)

**Context Window Status:**
- Current: ~132k/200k tokens (66% used)
- Fresh start recommended for Phase 17 implementation
- This session was documentation-heavy (appropriate)

---

## üöÄ To Continue (Next Session)

**Step 1: Initial Setup** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Push commits from previous session
git push origin feat/codex-ui-framework

# Verify branch state
git status
git log -3 --oneline
```

**Step 2: Load Context** (10 minutes)

Read in this order:
1. This handover document (you're reading it!)
2. [PHASE_17_PLAN.md](../phases/PHASE_17_PLAN.md) - Complete objectives
3. [ADR-015](../decisions/ADR-015-workspace-project-context-hierarchy.md) - Architecture
4. [ADR-016](../decisions/ADR-016-global-registry-storage.md) - Storage design
5. [Previous handover](./HANDOVER_2025-10-24-1630.md) - Subagent strategy

**Step 3: Start Phase 17 Part 1** (Implementation)

Use the `/phase-start` command if you want to formalize it, or just begin implementation directly since the plan is already comprehensive.

**Recommended approach** (from previous handover):
- Use subagent orchestration for Part 1's 8 discrete tasks
- Conserves context for complex refactoring
- Allows parallel development where possible

**First Task:** Database schema refactoring
- Read: `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/database.rs`
- Update schema: Add `projects` table, rename `projects` ‚Üí `contexts`, add `codex_contexts` join table
- See detailed task breakdown in PHASE_17_PLAN.md "Stage 0: Architectural Refactoring"

---

**Current Phase**: Phase 17 - Codex Editor Implementation & System Polish (Part 1: Refactoring)
**Branch**: `feat/codex-ui-framework`
**Context Window**: Fresh start recommended
**Estimated Duration**: Part 1 = 2-3 sessions, Part 2 = 2-3 sessions

**Philosophy**: Built incrementally by someone who needs it to exist. üõ†Ô∏è
