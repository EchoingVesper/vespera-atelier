## üéØ Current Focus
Phase 16b Stage 3: Codex Navigator now displays created codices successfully. Next: Implement Codex Viewer.

## ‚úÖ Just Completed (This Session)

### Major Fixes - Navigator Display Working
1. **Fixed async I/O deadlock in Bindery server**
   - Issue: All database operations (list_codices, create_codex) hung indefinitely
   - Root cause: stdin/stdout loop used `std::io::stdin()` (blocking I/O) instead of tokio async I/O
   - Fix: Replaced with `tokio::io::AsyncBufReadExt/AsyncWriteExt`, configured multi-threaded runtime
   - Commit: `9917411` - "fix(bindery): Fix async I/O deadlock"
   - Files: `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/bin/server.rs`

2. **Fixed missing project_id in list_codices results**
   - Issue: Navigator couldn't filter codices by project (all excluded from display)
   - Root cause: SQL query didn't include `project_id` in SELECT statement
   - Fix: Added `project_id` to query and returned JSON objects
   - Commit: `81707ac` - "fix(bindery): Include project_id in list_codices"
   - Files: `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/database.rs:1970-2008`

3. **Fixed "missing codex_id parameter" errors**
   - Issue: Navigator made repeated get_codex calls with wrong parameters
   - Root cause: Extension expected array of ID strings but server returned full objects
   - Fix: Modified Navigator to process full objects directly (eliminated unnecessary API calls)
   - Commit: `080dfff` - "fix(vespera-forge): Fix Navigator to process full codex objects"
   - Files: `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/views/NavigatorWebviewProvider.ts:295-331`

### Result
‚úÖ **END-TO-END CODEX CREATION NOW WORKS:**
- Create codex ‚Üí Saves to SQLite database ‚Üí Displays in Navigator
- User confirmed: "Finally! You did it! Those 2 Codices I made have appeared!"
- Navigator showing "New scene" and "New character" codices

## üöß In Progress
**Current Task**: None - just completed Navigator display functionality
**Status**: Navigator is working, ready to move to next component

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers / Issues
**None** - All blocking issues resolved

## üìã Next Up (Priority Order)

### 1. **Implement Codex Viewer** (NEXT TASK - User Priority)
**What**: Get the editor panel (center panel) to display and edit codex content when selected from Navigator

**Key Requirements:**
- Click codex in Navigator ‚Üí Opens in Editor panel
- Display codex metadata (title, template, tags, etc.)
- Render template-driven form fields
- Enable editing and saving changes back to Bindery

**Files to Check:**
- `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/views/EditorWebviewProvider.ts` - Main editor provider
- `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/webviews/editor/` - Editor UI components
- Check if there's existing editor code that needs updating

**Relevant Architecture Docs:**
- `docs/architecture/core/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Template-driven rendering
- `docs/architecture/core/CODEX_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Codex structure
- `docs/architecture/core/UI-Architecture-Three-Panel-Design.md` - Three-panel layout

### 2. **Test Multi-Project Workflow**
- Create second project
- Switch between projects in Navigator dropdown
- Verify codices filter correctly by project

### 3. **Push Commits to Remote**
- 23 unpushed commits on `feat/codex-ui-framework` branch
- Consider creating PR for review

### 4. **Address Technical Debt**
- 366 TODOs/FIXMEs in codebase
- 207 TypeScript linting warnings in extension (non-blocking)

## üß† Mental Model

### How Navigator Works Now:
1. **list_codices** returns full codex objects (not just IDs)
2. Navigator processes objects directly ‚Üí transformed to UI format
3. Project filtering happens client-side using `projectId` field
4. More efficient: One API call instead of N+1 (list + individual gets)

### Project-Centric Architecture:
- **All codices belong to a project** (project_id is required)
- Projects are fundamental entities (Phase 15 foundation)
- Navigator filters codices by current active project
- Templates filter by project type

### Three-Panel Design:
- **Left**: Navigator (tree view of codices) ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Center**: Editor (codex content editing) ‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT TO IMPLEMENT
- **Right**: AI Assistant (chat/context) (later)

## üìö Key Files for Context

### Recently Modified (This Session):
1. `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/bin/server.rs` - Fixed async I/O
2. `packages/vespera-utilities/vespera-bindery/src/database.rs` - Added project_id to queries
3. `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/views/NavigatorWebviewProvider.ts` - Fixed object processing

### For Next Task (Codex Viewer):
1. `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/views/EditorWebviewProvider.ts` - Editor panel provider
2. `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/webviews/editor/` - Editor UI components
3. `docs/architecture/core/TEMPLATE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - How to render templates

### Architecture Context:
1. `docs/architecture/core/PROJECT_CENTRIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` - ‚≠ê Start here for project context
2. `docs/architecture/core/HIERARCHICAL_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md` - ‚≠ê Template system design
3. `docs/architecture/core/CODEX_NESTING.md` - How codices nest

## üí° Quick Wins Identified

1. **More efficient API design**: Processing full objects from list_codices eliminated N+1 query problem
2. **Async I/O fix was straightforward**: Just needed tokio async I/O instead of std blocking I/O
3. **Extension compilation warnings are non-blocking**: 207 TypeScript warnings but builds successfully

## üîç Important Discoveries

1. **Bindery server requires multi-threaded runtime**: `#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 4)]`
2. **Incremental compilation can hide changes**: Required `cargo clean` to see async I/O fixes
3. **Extension expects specific object structure**: Navigator transforms flat Bindery response to nested UI format
4. **Project filtering happens client-side**: Bindery returns all codices, extension filters by projectId

## ‚è∞ Time-Sensitive Items
None

## üîß Environment Notes

**Current Setup:**
- Branch: `feat/codex-ui-framework` (23 commits ahead of origin)
- Working directory: `/home/aya/Development/vespera-atelier-worktrees/feat-codex-ui-framework`
- Bindery server: Running on JSON-RPC stdio mode
- VS Code extension: Compiled and loaded, Navigator working
- Test project: "test" (fiction project) with 2 codices created

**Database State:**
- SQLite database has projects and codices tables
- Current project: "test" (ID likely from project dropdown)
- 2 codices created: "New scene" and "New character"

**Build System:**
- Extension builds with webpack (despite 207 linting warnings)
- Bindery builds with cargo
- Extension must be reloaded after code changes: `F1 ‚Üí Developer: Reload Window`

1. Read `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/views/EditorWebviewProvider.ts`
2. Check `plugins/VSCode/vespera-forge/src/webviews/editor/` for existing UI
3. Understand how Navigator communicates selection to Editor
4. Implement click handler in Navigator to send codex to Editor
5. Implement Editor to receive and display codex data

**Current Phase**: Phase 16b - Project-Centric UI Framework
**Branch**: `feat/codex-ui-framework`
**Last Commit**: `080dfff` (Navigator display fix)
**Working Tree**: Clean ‚úÖ

## üéØ Success Criteria for Next Task

**Codex Viewer should:**
- [ ] Open when codex clicked in Navigator
- [ ] Display codex title and metadata
- [ ] Render template-driven form fields
- [ ] Show tags, relationships, timestamps
- [ ] Enable editing content
- [ ] Save changes back to Bindery database
- [ ] Update Navigator on save (if needed)

**Architecture Requirements:**
- [ ] Template-driven rendering (no hardcoded types)
- [ ] Project-aware (respects current project context)
- [ ] Follows three-panel design patterns
- [ ] Uses BinderyService for all backend calls

---

**Session End Summary:**
This session fixed critical blocking issues preventing codices from displaying in Navigator. The async I/O deadlock, missing project_id, and object processing mismatch are all resolved. Navigator now works end-to-end. Next session should focus on implementing the Codex Viewer (editor panel) to display and edit codex content.
