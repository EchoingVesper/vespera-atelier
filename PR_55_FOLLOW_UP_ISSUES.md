## Issue 1: Add Resource Disposal Patterns to Large Analyzer Classes

**Title:** Add Resource Disposal Patterns to Large Analyzer Classes  
**Labels:** refactor, maintenance, technical-debt, high-priority  

### Description
Based on PR review findings, large analyzer classes lack explicit disposal patterns which could lead to resource leaks and memory issues over time.

### Current State
- ✅ Large analyzer classes implemented and functional
- ❌ No explicit disposal patterns in UnusedPropertyAnalyzer (356 lines)
- ❌ No explicit disposal patterns in PropertyInvestigationTools (507 lines)
- ❌ No explicit disposal patterns in MultiChatStateManager (464 lines)
- ❌ Analysis results not cleared after processing

### Problem
Large analyzer classes are held in memory without clear cleanup strategies:
- File handles potentially not released properly
- Analysis results accumulate without cleanup
- Memory usage could grow indefinitely during long analysis sessions
- No dispose pattern for resource management

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement IDisposable pattern for large analyzer classes
- [ ] Add explicit resource cleanup methods
- [ ] Clear analysis results after processing completion
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring during analysis
- [ ] Implement timeout-based cleanup for abandoned analysis sessions
- [ ] Add unit tests for disposal patterns

### Priority
**High Priority** - Resource management is critical for extension stability during long-running analysis operations.

### Related Files
- `src/utils/cleanup/UnusedPropertyAnalyzer.ts` (356 lines)
- `src/utils/cleanup/PropertyInvestigationTools.ts` (507 lines)
- `src/chat/state/MultiChatStateManager.ts` (464 lines)

### References
- Related to PR #55 review findings
- Memory leak tests are already present but disposal patterns missing

## Issue 2: Add Integration Tests for UnusedPropertyAnalyzer

**Title:** Add Integration Tests for UnusedPropertyAnalyzer with Real TypeScript Files  
**Labels:** testing, integration, typescript, medium-priority

### Description
The UnusedPropertyAnalyzer system lacks integration tests with real TypeScript files, making it difficult to validate behavior in production scenarios.

### Current State
- ✅ Unit tests for individual components exist
- ✅ Memory leak tests present
- ❌ No integration tests with real TypeScript codebases
- ❌ No validation against actual unused property scenarios
- ❌ No end-to-end workflow testing

### Problem
Without integration tests:
- Cannot validate analyzer accuracy on real codebases
- Risk of false positives/negatives in production
- Difficult to test complex property usage patterns
- No confidence in phased analysis approach (2A, 2B, 2C)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create test fixtures with various TypeScript patterns
- [ ] Add integration tests for Phase 2A (Constructor refactoring)
- [ ] Add integration tests for Phase 2B (Service integration)
- [ ] Add integration tests for Phase 2C (Investigation & resolution)
- [ ] Test false positive detection with complex usage patterns
- [ ] Validate confidence scoring accuracy
- [ ] Test performance with large TypeScript files (1000+ lines)

### Priority
**Medium Priority** - Important for production reliability but existing unit tests provide basic coverage.

### Related Files
- `src/utils/cleanup/UnusedPropertyAnalyzer.ts`
- `src/utils/cleanup/PropertyInvestigationTools.ts`
- Test fixtures needed in `/test/fixtures/typescript/`

- [ ] Test task server integration end-to-end
- [ ] Test session recovery after extension restart
- [ ] Test security features in integrated environment
- [ ] Add performance testing for multiple concurrent chats

- ❌ No formal performance benchmarks
- ❌ No scalability testing for large codebases
- ❌ No performance regression detection

### Problem
Without performance benchmarks:

- [ ] Benchmark memory usage during large analysis sessions
- [ ] Test performance with varying file sizes (100, 1K, 10K lines)
- [ ] Benchmark cross-file dependency analysis
- [ ] Add performance regression testing in CI
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and limits
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

### Priority
**Medium Priority** - Important for scalability but current implementation shows good architectural patterns.

## Issue 5: Expand Documentation for Complex Analysis Algorithms

**Title:** Expand Inline Documentation for Complex TypeScript Analysis Algorithms

### Description
Complex analysis algorithms in the TypeScript cleanup system need more comprehensive inline documentation for maintainability.

### Current State
- ✅ Code is well-structured and readable
- ✅ Strategic data provides high-level context
- ❌ Complex algorithms lack detailed inline documentation
- ❌ No architectural decision documentation
- ❌ Limited examples for complex analysis patterns

### Problem
Without comprehensive documentation:
- Difficult for new contributors to understand complex logic
