I need a comprehensive parallel base PRP for "Writing Organization Infrastructure Research" that combines market analysis, technical architecture research, and writing workflow best practices.

Research Goals:

1. **Writing Organization Best Practices**: Research structure approaches for essays, non-fiction, and fiction writing projects - including academic, technical documentation, and creative writing standards

2. **Obsidian vs Custom Solution Analysis**:
- Deep dive into Obsidian's new "Bases" feature - what type of database, capabilities, vector/graph potential
- Plugin ecosystem analysis vs building custom GUI
- Monovault vs multi-vault approaches for GraphRAG integration

3. **Vespera Atelier Architecture Decision**:
- Technical feasibility analysis: Obsidian plugin integration vs standalone app
- Scalability for AI art generation, 2D/3D character modeling, environment building
- Database requirements for AI-assisted writing templates, asset management, and creative workflows

4. **Market Research & Competitive Analysis**:
- Existing creative platform solutions and their limitations
- Technical packages/libraries available for creative tool development
- User needs analysis for integrated creative workflows

Target Outcome: Comprehensive PRP with specific architectural recommendations for organizing both the essay collection we just outlined AND the broader Vespera Atelier creative platform, with detailed technical justification for chosen approach.

Current Context: Working from E:\dev\documents\essays\planned-essays\ with 16+ essay outlines that need organization into book-length projects, while planning broader creative platform architecture.

Create parallel research agents to investigate all angles and synthesize into actionable implementation plan.
