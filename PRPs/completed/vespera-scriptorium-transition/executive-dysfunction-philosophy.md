## Core Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Vespera Scriptorium is fundamentally a **disability aid for executive dysfunction**. Every design
decision must be evaluated through the lens of:

> Does this reduce lid weight, preserve momentum, delegate pressure, or prevent damage?

## The Pressure-Lid Metaphor

### Understanding the Model

Executive dysfunction operates like a **pressure cooker with a weighted lid**:
- **Pressure**: Mental/emotional energy needed for tasks
- **Lid Weight**: Barriers to task initiation (decisions, complexity, unclear steps)
- **Vents**: Healthy pressure release mechanisms
- **Damage**: What happens when pressure exceeds capacity

### Design Implications for Vespera Scriptorium

#### 1. Lid Weight Reduction Strategies

**Pre-Created Structure**:
- Directory hierarchies exist before needed
- Numbered naming conventions (00-99) eliminate choice paralysis
- Template systems reduce "blank page" syndrome
- Clear working vs. manual directories

**Decision Elimination**:
- Git worktree strategy pre-defined
- Agent isolation patterns established
- Progress tracking automatically structured
- File naming conventions standardized

#### 2. Momentum Preservation Mechanisms

**Session Continuity**:
- Orchestrator sessions survive sleep resets
- Git auto-preservation via WIP commits
- Context maintained across interruptions
- Progress visible at multiple granularities

**Work Recovery**:
- All detailed work in orchestrator artifacts
- Session state automatically preserved
- Clear resumption points documented
- No work lost to overwhelm or crashes

#### 3. Pressure Delegation Architecture

**Agent Specialization**:
- Heavy cognitive tasks assigned to specialist agents
- Main coordination agent handles orchestration only
- Parallel work via git worktree isolation
- Results synthesized automatically

**Automated Coordination**:
- Orchestrator handles complex task dependencies
- Progress monitoring reduces manual tracking overhead
- Artifact storage eliminates manual summary writing
- Template systems spawn agents automatically

#### 4. Damage Prevention Systems

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Work preserved even when overwhelmed
- Clear exit strategies from complex tasks
- Recovery procedures documented
- No catastrophic failure modes

**Overwhelm Detection**:
- Progress tracking identifies stuck points
- Multiple work granularities available
- Clear scope boundaries for each agent
- Automatic checkpoint creation

## Vespera Scriptorium Specific Applications

### 1. Template System Design

**Problem**: Starting new projects creates decision paralysis  
**ED Solution**: Pre-created templates with agent-spawning hooks  
**Implementation**: One-command project initialization with full structure

### 2. Documentation Automation

**Problem**: Maintaining documentation requires ongoing decisions  
**ED Solution**: Auto-generated docs from orchestrator artifacts  
**Implementation**: Documentation updates automatically from completed work

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination

**Problem**: Managing multiple work streams creates overwhelm  
**ED Solution**: Orchestrator manages all coordination  
**Implementation**: Agents work in isolation, results synthesized automatically

### 4. Git Worktree Strategy

**Problem**: Merge conflicts and branch management increase cognitive load  
**ED Solution**: Isolated worktrees with automatic conflict prevention  
**Implementation**: Each agent gets dedicated workspace, merges handled systematically

## Success Metrics Through ED Lens

### Lid Weight Reduction Metrics

- [ ] Time from idea to first code: < 5 minutes
- [ ] Decisions required for project start: < 3
- [ ] Manual setup steps eliminated: 90%+
- [ ] Template application success rate: 100%

### Momentum Preservation Metrics

- [ ] Work recovery after interruption: < 30 seconds
- [ ] Context loss across sleep: 0%
- [ ] Progress visibility granularities: 3+ levels
- [ ] Session continuity success rate: 100%

### Pressure Delegation Metrics

- [ ] Manual coordination overhead: < 10%
- [ ] Agent work isolation success: 100%
- [ ] Automated result synthesis: 100%
- [ ] Cognitive load distribution effectiveness: measurable

### Damage Prevention Metrics

- [ ] Work loss incidents: 0
- [ ] Recovery from overwhelm: < 5 minutes
- [ ] Graceful degradation paths: documented for all scenarios
- [ ] User stress reduction: measurable via self-report

## Implementation Principles

### 1. ED-First Architecture

Every system component must answer:
- How does this reduce barriers to starting?
- How does this preserve work across interruptions?
- How does this distribute cognitive load?
- How does this prevent catastrophic failure?

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Essential functions immediately visible
- Advanced features available but not overwhelming
- Clear hierarchy of importance
- Optional complexity layers

### 3. Automated Coordination

- Minimize manual decision points
- Automate routine task management
- Provide clear guidance for non-routine decisions
- Maintain context automatically

### 4. Multi-Modal Support

- Visual progress indicators
- Text-based status reports
- Automated reminders and prompts
- Multiple interaction patterns

## Future Evolution Considerations

### Agent-to-Agent Architecture

When agent-to-agent communication is fully implemented:
- **Enhanced Pressure Delegation**: Agents coordinate directly
- **Reduced Main Agent Load**: Less manual coordination required
- **Automated Undo Capabilities**: Complete work history enables rollback
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Agents redistribute work based on capacity

### Advanced ED Features

- **Overwhelm Detection**: Biometric integration for stress monitoring
- **Adaptive Complexity**: System complexity adjusts to current capacity
- **Predictive Support**: AI anticipates needs based on patterns
- **Community Integration**: Shared templates and patterns from ED community

## Validation Questions

For any new feature or change, ask:

1. **Lid Weight**: Does this make starting easier or harder?
2. **Momentum**: Does this preserve progress across interruptions?
3. **Pressure**: Does this distribute cognitive load effectively?
4. **Damage**: Does this prevent or enable catastrophic failure?
5. **Recovery**: Can users recover quickly from overwhelm or errors?

**Remember**: Vespera Scriptorium succeeds when it makes complex creative and technical work accessible to minds that
struggle with executive function. Every technical decision is an accessibility decision.
