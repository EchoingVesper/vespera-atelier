# Priority 8: Phase 3 Cancelled Tests Analysis

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: [TODO]  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Specialist Type**: devops + tester  
**Local LLM Ready**: ‚úÖ High (with research phase)
**Test Category**: Cancelled Tests (4 tests)

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: 4 GitHub Actions tests are being cancelled before completion, indicating workflow interruption or configuration issues.

**Impact**: These cancellations may indicate underlying problems that could affect other tests or workflow reliability.

**Analysis Required**: Need to understand why these tests are being cancelled and whether they should complete successfully or be properly configured.

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: 4 individual cancelled tests analyzed separately  
**Momentum Preservation**: Each test gets dedicated research + implementation agent pair  
**Pressure Delegation**: Distributed across 8 agents (4 research + 4 implementation)
**Damage Prevention**: Determine if cancellation is intentional or problematic

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Research Analysis (4 agents)
- **Duration**: 1-1.5 hours
- **Agents**: 4 research specialists
- **Deliverables**: Cancellation cause analysis for each test
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions logs, workflow configuration analysis

### Phase 1: Implementation Fixes (4 agents)  
- **Duration**: 1-1.5 hours
- **Agents**: 4 implementation specialists
- **Dependencies**: Corresponding research phase completion
- **Deliverables**: Cancellation fixes or proper configuration

## Test Categories (Cancelled - 4 tests)

### Expected Cancellation Types
- **Workflow Dependencies**: Tests cancelled due to dependency failures
- **Resource Limits**: Tests cancelled due to timeout or resource constraints
- **Configuration Issues**: Tests cancelled due to invalid configuration
- **Intentional Cancellation**: Tests that should be cancelled (and need proper handling)

## Analysis Focus Areas

**For Each Cancelled Test:**
1. **Cancellation Point**: When in the workflow does cancellation occur?
2. **Cancellation Trigger**: What condition causes the cancellation?
3. **Expected Behavior**: Should the test run to completion or be cancelled?
4. **Dependencies**: Are there upstream failures causing cancellation?
5. **Resource Requirements**: Are resource limits being exceeded?

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Priority Task**:
```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3 Cancelled Tests Analysis and Resolution" \
  description="Analysis and resolution for 4 cancelled GitHub Actions tests" \
  complexity="moderate" \
  task_type="breakdown" \
  specialist_type="coordinator" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern

**Workflow**: Research ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

1. **Research Agents (4)**:
   - Each analyzes one specific cancelled test
   - Investigate workflow logs and cancellation points
   - Determine if cancellation is intended or problematic
   - Research proper configuration for test requirements

2. **Implementation Agents (4)**:
   - Receive research findings from corresponding research agent
   - Implement appropriate fix or configuration
   - Test that cancellation is resolved or properly handled
   - Document resolution approach

## Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All 4 cancelled tests analyzed for cancellation cause
- [ ] Determination made: intentional vs problematic cancellation
- [ ] Fixes implemented for problematic cancellations
- [ ] Proper handling configured for intentional cancellations
- [ ] All cancelled tests either pass or are properly excluded

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Clear understanding of each test's cancellation behavior
- [ ] Appropriate action taken for each cancellation type
- [ ] No unexpected test cancellations in final run
- [ ] Workflow reliability improved

## Expected Outcomes

**Possible Resolutions per Test:**
- **Fix and Run**: Test configuration fixed, now runs to completion
- **Proper Exclusion**: Test properly excluded from workflow with documentation
- **Conditional Execution**: Test configured to run only when appropriate
- **Dependency Resolution**: Test dependencies fixed, cancellation resolved
