# Research Phase: Cancelled Tests Analysis

This phase contains individual research tasks for each cancelled test.

## Subtasks (4 research agents)

Each research agent analyzes one specific cancelled test to:
- Identify root cause of cancelled behavior
- Research proper configuration and solutions
- Document implementation approach
- Prepare detailed analysis for implementation agent

## Execution Pattern

1. **Individual Analysis**: Each agent takes one cancelled test
2. **Deep Investigation**: Thorough analysis of cancelled cause
3. **Solution Research**: Research best practices and solutions
4. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed plan for implementation agent

## Expected Deliverables

- Root cause analysis for each cancelled test
- Solution approaches with implementation guidance
- Environment and configuration requirements
- All findings stored in orchestrator artifacts
