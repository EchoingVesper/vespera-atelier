# Priority 7: Phase 3 Failed Tests Deep Analysis

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: [TODO]  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Specialist Type**: devops + tester  
**Local LLM Ready**: ‚úÖ High (with research phase)
**Test Category**: Failed Tests (23 tests)

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: 23 GitHub Actions tests are failing consistently, preventing PR merge and blocking development workflow.

**Impact**: Cannot merge any changes until all tests pass. Development velocity severely impacted.

**Root Cause Analysis Needed**: These tests have been failing for extended periods and previous fixes have not resolved the underlying issues. Each test needs individual deep-dive analysis.

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: 23 individual failed tests analyzed separately to prevent overwhelm  
**Momentum Preservation**: Each test gets dedicated research + implementation agent pair  
**Pressure Delegation**: Distributed across 46 agents (23 research + 23 implementation)
**Damage Prevention**: Each fix tested in isolation before integration

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Research Analysis (23 agents)
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Agents**: 23 research specialists
- **Deliverables**: Root cause analysis for each failed test
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions logs, error analysis, online research

### Phase 1: Implementation Fixes (23 agents)  
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Agents**: 23 implementation specialists
- **Dependencies**: Corresponding research phase completion
- **Deliverables**: Individual test fixes with validation

## Test Categories (Failed - 23 tests)

### Subcategory Breakdown
We'll need to categorize the 23 failed tests by type once we analyze them:

**Expected Categories:**
- **Python Environment Issues**: Tests failing due to dependency/environment problems
- **Workflow Configuration**: Tests failing due to GitHub Actions configuration
- **Package Build Issues**: Tests failing during build/packaging steps
- **Integration Test Failures**: Tests failing due to cross-component issues
- **Security/Permission Issues**: Tests failing due to access/permission problems

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Priority Task**:
```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3 Failed Tests Analysis and Fixes" \
  description="Deep analysis and fixes for 23 consistently failing GitHub Actions tests" \
  complexity="very_complex" \
  task_type="breakdown" \
  specialist_type="coordinator" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern

**Workflow**: Research ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

1. **Research Agents (23)**:
   - Each gets one specific failed test to analyze
   - Deep-dive into test logs, configuration, and requirements
   - Research best practices and solutions online
   - Document root cause and proposed solution

2. **Implementation Agents (23)**:
   - Each receives research from corresponding research agent
   - Implements the specific fix for their assigned test
   - Tests the fix in isolation 
   - Documents implementation and validation results

## Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All 23 failed tests analyzed individually
- [ ] Root cause identified for each test failure
- [ ] Implementation plan created for each test
- [ ] Fixes implemented and validated for each test
- [ ] All tests transition from "failed" to "passed" status

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Each research phase produces actionable root cause analysis
- [ ] Each implementation phase produces working test fix
- [ ] Integration testing confirms no regressions
- [ ] Final GitHub Actions run shows all 23 tests passing

## Next Steps

1. **Gather Test Details**: Extract exact test names and failure details from GitHub Actions
2. **Create Subtasks**: Generate 23 research + 23 implementation subtasks
3. **Assign Agents**: Spawn 46 individual agents via orchestrator
4. **Execute Research**: Complete all research phases before implementation
5. **Execute Fixes**: Implement all fixes with continuous validation
6. **Integration Test**: Verify all tests pass together
