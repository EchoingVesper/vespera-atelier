# Phase 3: Strategic Research Coordination

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: [TODO]  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours (research only)  
**Specialist Type**: researcher + analyst  
**Local LLM Ready**: ‚úÖ High
**GitHub PR**: [#15 Checks](https://github.com/EchoingVesper/vespera-atelier/pull/15/checks)

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: 37 GitHub Actions tests are failing with unknown root causes, requiring systematic analysis before implementation.

**Strategic Approach**: Research first, analyze patterns, then create targeted implementation plan based on actual findings rather than assumptions.

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: Strategic analysis prevents overwhelming implementation attempts  
**Momentum Preservation**: Clear research ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí implementation pipeline  
**Pressure Delegation**: Systematic categorization reduces decision complexity
**Damage Prevention**: No premature fixes without understanding root causes

## Phase 3 Strategic Structure

### Phase 3A: Individual Test Research (37 agents)
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Agents**: 37 research specialists
- **Input**: GitHub PR #15 checks with actual test details
- **Output**: Comprehensive root cause analysis for each failing test

### Phase 3B: Analysis and Categorization (1 coordinator agent)
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes  
- **Agent**: 1 analysis specialist
- **Input**: All 37 research findings
- **Output**: Categorized problems with consolidated implementation strategy

### Phase 3C: Implementation Planning (Conditional)
- **Duration**: TBD based on Phase 3B findings
- **Agents**: TBD based on problem categories discovered
- **Input**: Categorized problems and implementation strategy
- **Output**: Targeted implementation plan (likely fewer than 37 agents)

## Research Methodology

### Data Extraction Strategy
```bash
# Extract real test details from GitHub PR #15
Source: https://github.com/EchoingVesper/vespera-atelier/pull/15/checks

Test Categories to Research:
1. Failed Tests (23) - Extract exact test names, error messages, failure points
2. Cancelled Tests (4) - Identify cancellation triggers and dependency failures  
3. Hanging Tests (6) - Analyze hang points and resource usage
4. Skipped Tests (4) - Determine skip reasons and appropriateness
```

### Individual Research Agent Instructions
Each research agent will:

1. **Test Identification**
   - Extract actual test name from GitHub Actions
   - Identify specific workflow file and step
   - Document exact command that fails
   - Note test category and execution environment

2. **Failure Analysis**  
   - Copy exact error messages from logs
   - Identify failure point in execution
   - Analyze stack traces and exit codes
   - Document environment context (Python/Node versions, dependencies)

3. **Root Cause Investigation**
   - Research error patterns online
   - Check for known issues with specific tools/versions
   - Analyze monorepo integration impact
   - Identify if issue is environment, configuration, or code-related

4. **Solution Research**
   - Research proven solutions for this specific error type
   - Document configuration requirements
   - Identify dependencies that need to be updated
   - Note potential impact on other tests

## Phase Gates and Dependencies

### Phase 3A Completion Gate
**Requirements for Phase 3B:**
- [ ] All 37 research tasks completed with findings stored in orchestrator
- [ ] Each research includes: test name, error details, root cause, solution approach
- [ ] No research agent failures or timeouts
- [ ] All findings validated for completeness

### Phase 3B Analysis Gate  
**Requirements for Phase 3C:**
- [ ] Problem categorization completed (likely categories: environment, config, code, monorepo)
- [ ] Implementation strategy developed based on actual findings
- [ ] Resource requirements estimated for implementation phase
- [ ] Risk assessment completed for proposed solutions

### Error Recovery Protocols

```yaml
research_agent_failure:
  timeout_after: "20_minutes"
  retry_limit: "1_attempt"
  escalation: "manual_investigation_required"
  fallback: "mark_test_for_manual_analysis"

missing_test_data:
  action: "extract_from_github_directly"
  fallback: "use_placeholder_and_mark_for_update"

incomplete_research:
  validation: "check_required_fields_completed"
  remediation: "spawn_focused_research_agent"
```

## Expected Research Outcomes

### Likely Problem Categories
Based on the 37 failing tests, we expect to find:

1. **Environment Issues** (estimated 40-50% of problems)
   - Python version mismatches
   - Missing system dependencies  
   - Node.js/npm/pnpm version conflicts
   - Package installation failures

2. **Configuration Issues** (estimated 30-40% of problems)
   - GitHub Actions workflow configuration
   - Test runner configuration
   - Path resolution in monorepo
   - Environment variable setup

3. **Code/Import Issues** (estimated 10-20% of problems)
   - Import path issues from monorepo migration
   - Deprecated API usage
   - Test code that needs updating
   - Missing test dependencies

4. **Infrastructure Issues** (estimated 5-10% of problems)
   - Resource timeouts
   - Network connectivity
   - GitHub Actions runner limitations
   - Concurrency issues

### Consolidation Opportunities
After research, we expect to consolidate 37 implementation tasks into:
- **5-10 environment fix tasks** (batch similar dependency/version issues)
- **3-5 configuration fix tasks** (batch workflow configuration updates)
- **2-4 code fix tasks** (batch import/path resolution issues)
- **1-2 infrastructure tasks** (batch timeout/resource issues)

**Result**: Instead of 37 implementation agents, likely need only 10-15 targeted fix agents.

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Phase 3A Task**:
```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3A: Individual Test Research Analysis" \
  description="Systematic research of 37 failing tests to identify root causes before implementation" \
  complexity="complex" \
  task_type="research" \
  specialist_type="researcher" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

**Create Phase 3B Task** (dependent on 3A):
```bash  
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3B: Research Analysis and Problem Categorization" \
  description="Analyze 37 research findings to categorize problems and create targeted implementation strategy" \
  complexity="moderate" \
  task_type="analysis" \
  specialist_type="analyst" \
  dependencies=["phase_3a_completion"] \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 3A Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All 37 tests researched with actual GitHub Actions data
- [ ] Root causes identified for each failing test
- [ ] Solution approaches documented for each test
- [ ] Research findings stored in orchestrator artifacts
- [ ] No assumptions - all analysis based on real error data

**Phase 3B Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] Problems categorized by type (environment, config, code, infrastructure)
- [ ] Implementation strategy created based on findings
- [ ] Consolidation opportunities identified (37 ‚Üí ~10-15 tasks)
- [ ] Risk assessment and resource requirements documented
- [ ] Clear go/no-go decision for Phase 3C implementation

## Key Strategic Benefits

1. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Decisions based on actual error data, not assumptions
2. **Consolidation Opportunities**: Likely reduce 37 ‚Üí 10-15 implementation tasks
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Understand problems before attempting fixes
4. **Resource Optimization**: Focus implementation effort on actual root causes
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify systematic issues affecting multiple tests
