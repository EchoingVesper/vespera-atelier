# Index Directory - Auto-Generated Content

This directory contains auto-generated indices created during Meta-PRP execution.

## Purpose

- Navigation aids for complex task structures
- Cross-references between related tasks  
- Quick access to frequently needed information
- Progress visualization
- Dependency tracking

## Do Not Edit

Files in this directory are generated automatically. Manual edits will be overwritten.

## Generated Files

**Navigation Indices**:

- `file-index.json` - Complete file listing with metadata
- `cross-references.md` - Links between related tasks
- `quick-nav.md` - Fast access to important documents

**Progress Tracking**:

- `progress-summary.md` - Current execution status
- `completion-stats.json` - Quantitative progress metrics
- `task-status-grid.md` - Visual status overview

**Dependency Management**:

- `dependency-graph.dot` - Visual task dependencies  
- `dependency-analysis.json` - Dependency relationships
- `blocking-issues.md` - Current blockers and resolution plans

**Orchestrator Integration**:

- `session-summary.json` - Current orchestrator session info
- `task-mapping.json` - Meta-PRP to orchestrator task mapping
- `artifact-references.md` - Links to orchestrator artifacts

## Updates

This directory is refreshed automatically:

- During orchestrator task execution
- When progress milestones are reached
- On meta-PRP status updates
- When new tasks are created or completed

## Access Patterns

- **Main Navigation**: Use `quick-nav.md` for fast access
- **Progress Review**: Check `progress-summary.md` for current status  
- **Dependency Issues**: Review `blocking-issues.md` for problems
- **Detailed Analysis**: Use JSON files for programmatic access
