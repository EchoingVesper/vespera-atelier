# Comprehensive Test Suite Replacement - Main Coordination

**Meta-PRP ID**: `TEST_SUITE_REPLACEMENT_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Coordination with Full Orchestrator Integration  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Status**: [IN-PROGRESS]  
**Orchestrator Session**: `{session_id}`  
**Parent Task ID**: `{task_id}`

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

This meta-PRP integrates systematic approach methodology proven successful in atomic CI fixes:

### Research-First Enforcement
- **Mandatory research phase** before any test deletion or creation
- **Comprehensive data gathering** about current architecture and legacy test issues
- **Pattern recognition** to understand root causes of test failures

### Infrastructure Stability Focus
- **Foundational test framework** that supports future development velocity
- **Clean Architecture alignment** throughout all test implementations
- **Automated validation hooks** to prevent future regression introduction

### Hook Integration Strategy
- **Test validation hooks** to catch test quality issues before CI/CD
- **Architecture compliance hooks** to ensure tests align with Clean Architecture
- **Regression prevention hooks** to maintain test suite integrity

## Executive Summary

Replace legacy test suite (pre-clean-architecture) discovered during atomic CI fixes with comprehensive Clean Architecture-aligned test infrastructure.

**Discovery Context**: 6 "hanging" tests were legacy tests with hundreds of errors:
- Wrong parameter counts, missing definitions, import errors
- Pre-clean-architecture assumptions incompatible with current implementation
- Testing patterns that don't align with domain-driven design

**Systematic Solution**: Apply proven methodology from CI fixes success to build comprehensive test replacement.

## Systematic Research Phase Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Complete comprehensive research before any implementation:

### Phase 1: Legacy Test Analysis
- **Comprehensive inventory** of all legacy test files and their failure patterns
- **Root cause analysis** of why tests are incompatible with Clean Architecture
- **Pattern documentation** of common failure types and architectural assumptions

### Phase 2: Clean Architecture Mapping
- **Current architecture assessment** across domain/application/infrastructure layers
- **Test coverage gap identification** using systematic analysis
- **Integration point mapping** for database, MCP, and external service testing

### Phase 3: Hook Integration Planning
- **Automated validation design** for test quality assurance
- **CI/CD integration planning** for sustainable testing infrastructure
- **Regression prevention strategy** to avoid future test architecture drift

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Requirements
- **Test harness design** for each architectural layer
- **Mock and stub strategy** for clean dependency isolation
