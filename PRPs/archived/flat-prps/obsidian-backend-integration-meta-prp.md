# Meta-PRP: Obsidian Plugin Backend Integration Research & Planning

**Meta-PRP ID**: OBSIDIAN_BACKEND_INTEGRATION_RESEARCH  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Research and Planning Coordination  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for Multi-Model AI System  
**Target**: Plugin Modernization + Backend Integration  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 3-4 weeks research + 6-8 weeks implementation  
**Orchestrator Session**: session_6375af58_1755338579  
**Prerequisites**: CI fixes from atomic-ci-fixes-meta-prp.md must be completed first

## Executive Summary

This meta-PRP coordinates comprehensive research and planning for modernizing the Obsidian Vespera-Scriptorium plugin and integrating it with the mature vespera-scriptorium backend. The goal is to create a **hierarchical multi-model AI orchestration system** that serves as both a standalone MCP server and an integrated plugin+backend solution capable of processing large-scale Discord logs through local and cloud LLMs.

## Vision Statement

Transform the legacy Obsidian plugin into a modern frontend for a **hierarchical AI orchestration system** that intelligently routes tasks between:

- **Local LLMs** (8GB VRAM constraint) for repetitive, atomic tasks
- **Medium models** for standard processing and summarization  
- **Large models** for complex reasoning and creative decisions

**End Goal**: Process nearly a year's worth of Discord chat logs to extract, organize, and transcribe story/setting information into a structured knowledge base.

## Prerequisite: CI Fixes Must Be Completed

**üö® CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**: This meta-PRP **CANNOT BE EXECUTED** until the CI fixes from `PRPs/atomic-ci-fixes-meta-prp.md` are completed.

**Reasons**:

1. Plugin integration requires stable CI/CD pipeline
2. Backend changes need reliable testing framework
3. Multi-package coordination depends on working monorepo configuration
4. Development workflow requires branch protection and working maintenance

**Validation Before Proceeding**:

```bash
# Verify CI fixes are complete
gh workflow list --repo EchoingVesper/vespera-atelier | grep -E "(CI|Maintenance)" | grep "active"
pnpm install --dry-run  # Should work without workspace errors
```

## Final Note: Post-CI Execution Only

**üö® REMINDER**: This meta-PRP execution is **blocked** until CI fixes from `PRPs/atomic-ci-fixes-meta-prp.md` are completed. The comprehensive research requires a stable development environment with working CI/CD, proper workspace configuration, and reliable testing infrastructure.

**Execution Trigger**: Only proceed when CI health check shows all workflows passing and workspace configuration is resolved.
