# Comprehensive Test Suite Replacement Meta-PRP

**Meta-PRP ID**: `TEST_SUITE_REPLACEMENT_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Coordination with Full Orchestrator Integration  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Status**: [IN-PROGRESS]  
**Created**: 2025-01-17

## Executive Summary

Replace the legacy test suite (pre-clean-architecture) that was causing 6 "hanging" tests and hundreds of errors with a comprehensive test suite aligned with the current Clean Architecture implementation.

**Discovery Context**: During atomic CI fixes meta-PRP execution, we discovered that 6 tests appearing to "hang" were actually legacy tests from before the clean architecture refactor. These tests had:

- Hundreds of errors (wrong parameter counts, missing definitions, import errors)
- Pre-clean-architecture assumptions about codebase structure
- Incompatible with current domain-driven design patterns

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

This meta-PRP is designed with systematic approach methodology proven successful in atomic CI fixes:

- **Research-First**: Comprehensive analysis before implementation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify testing patterns for Clean Architecture alignment
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Build foundational test infrastructure for future velocity
- **Hook Integration**: Automated test validation to prevent regression introduction

## Priority Structure

### Priority 1: Research and Analysis (Day 1)

**Location**: [01-research-analysis/](01-research-analysis/index.md)  
**Status**: Pending

### Priority 2: Legacy Test Archive (Day 1-2)

**Location**: [02-legacy-archive/](02-legacy-archive/index.md)  
**Status**: Pending  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `archive-001` through `archive-003`  
**Issue**: Safe preservation and archival of legacy test artifacts

### Priority 3: Core Test Infrastructure (Day 2-3)

**Location**: [03-core-infrastructure/](03-core-infrastructure/index.md)  
**Status**: Pending

## Systematic Approach Integration

**Lessons Learned from CI Fixes Success:**

### Research-First Methodology

- Complete comprehensive analysis before any test deletion/creation
- Identify patterns in legacy test failures to understand architectural gaps
- Map current Clean Architecture to required test coverage

### Pattern Recognition Framework

- Analyze why legacy tests are failing to understand architectural changes
- Identify systematic testing patterns for domain/application/infrastructure layers
- Design test categories that prevent future architectural drift

### Infrastructure Focus

- Build test foundation that supports future development velocity
- Create automated test validation hooks to prevent regression introduction
- Establish CI/CD integration patterns for sustainable testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] **Legacy Test Issues Resolved**: All 6 "hanging" tests addressed through archival
- [ ] **Clean Architecture Coverage**: 95%+ test coverage across all architectural layers
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: All new tests pass in GitHub Actions consistently
- [ ] **Hook Integration**: Automated test validation prevents future regression introduction
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: Clear testing patterns documented for future development
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**: Foundational testing framework supports rapid feature development
