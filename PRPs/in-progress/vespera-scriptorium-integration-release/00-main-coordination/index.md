# Vespera Scriptorium Integration & Release Preparation - Main Coordination

**Meta-PRP ID**: `VESPERA_SCRIPTORIUM_INTEGRATION_META_PRP_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Coordination with Full Orchestrator Integration  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Status**: [IN-PROGRESS]  
**Orchestrator Session**: `session_d37b25ab_1755249353`  
**Parent Task ID**: `task_13141d21`

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

**Core ED Principles for This Meta-PRP**:

- **Momentum Preservation**: Builds on completed Phase 1 specialist work, avoiding re-planning overhead
- **Lid Weight Reduction**: Scaffolded meta-PRP structure with pre-filled orchestrator tasks eliminates setup decisions
- **Pressure Delegation**: 4 clear priority areas with specialist assignments and orchestrator coordination
- **Damage Prevention**: Incremental integration approach prevents overwhelming monolithic changes

**Project-Specific ED Considerations**:
Post-migration integration is particularly prone to abandonment - the "exciting" transition work is done, now we need sustained focus on the "boring" cleanup and release work. The structured approach with visible progress milestones fights this tendency.

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 of the Vespera Scriptorium transition successfully completed the monorepo migration and specialist coordination work. Four specialist agents (DevOps, Documentation, Architecture, Platform) completed comprehensive analysis and design work that's ready for implementation. However, critical infrastructure issues remain: 50% test failure rates, incomplete naming migration, and missing CI/CD setup in the new structure.

This Phase 2 meta-PRP systematically implements all the completed specialist work while fixing the infrastructure foundation. We're not starting from scratch - we're executing against proven designs and analyses from Phase 1. The focus is integration and release preparation rather than planning and design.

Success means a fully functional Vespera Scriptorium 1.0.0 ready for public release: passing tests, working CI/CD, consistent naming throughout, and all specialist recommendations implemented. The monorepo will serve both as a standalone MCP server and as a coordinated package ecosystem.

## Priority Structure

### Priority 1: CI/CD Infrastructure & Test Cleanup (Week 1)
**Location**: [01-ci-cd-infrastructure/](../01-ci-cd-infrastructure/index.md)  
**Status**: [IN-PROGRESS]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `task_5d273c30`  
**Issue**: 50% test failure rate and missing CI/CD pipeline block development and release
**Deliverables**: Working test suite, automated CI/CD pipeline, build system for monorepo

### Priority 2: Complete Naming Consistency Migration (Week 1-2)
**Location**: [02-naming-consistency/](../02-naming-consistency/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `task_f2affadf`  
**Issue**: "Task orchestrator" references throughout codebase prevent consistent branding
**Deliverables**: All code, configs, and docs consistently use "Vespera Scriptorium"

### Priority 3: Integrate Phase 1 Specialist Work (Week 2)
**Location**: [03-specialist-integration/](../03-specialist-integration/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `task_d91d33e8`  
**Issue**: Completed specialist designs and fixes need implementation in monorepo structure
**Deliverables**: DevOps fixes applied, documentation system live, template architecture integrated

### Priority 4: 1.0.0 Release Preparation (Week 2-3)
**Location**: [04-release-preparation/](../04-release-preparation/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `task_fb28718b`  
**Issue**: Public release readiness requires version strategy, packaging, and comprehensive testing
**Deliverables**: UV integration, semantic versioning, release documentation, public 1.0.0 release
**Location**: [04-{priority-4-slug}/](../04-{priority-4-slug}/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `{task_range}`  
**Issue**: {What problem this priority solves}  
**Deliverables**: {Key outputs expected}

## Multi-Agent Coordination Structure

**Orchestrator Role**: Primary coordination hub for all specialist agents

**Agent Hierarchy**:
1. **Main Coordinator** (This agent): Orchestrates entire meta-PRP
2. **Priority Specialists**: One per priority area with domain expertise
3. **Implementation Agents**: Task-specific execution agents spawned as needed

**Coordination Workflow**:
1. Initialize orchestrator session from this directory
2. Create parent task for meta-PRP coordination
3. Break down into priority-specific subtasks
4. Spawn specialist agents for each priority area
5. Monitor progress and synthesize results
6. Complete meta-PRP with comprehensive artifacts

**Git Worktree Strategy**: {Yes, using isolation for parallel work / No, sequential approach}
