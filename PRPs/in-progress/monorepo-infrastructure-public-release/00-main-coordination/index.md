# Monorepo Infrastructure & Public Release Readiness - Main Coordination

**Meta-PRP ID**: `MONOREPO_INFRASTRUCTURE_META_PRP_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Coordination with Full Orchestrator Integration  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Status**: [IN-PROGRESS]  
**Orchestrator Session**: `session_4327ad7b_1755258007`  
**Parent Task ID**: `{To be assigned during task creation}`

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

**Core ED Principles for This Meta-PRP**:

- **Momentum Preservation**: Builds on successful 924-file meta-PRP completion, addressing real user feedback to maintain forward progress
- **Lid Weight Reduction**: Pre-categorized infrastructure priorities (onboarding, CI/CD, docs, monitoring) eliminate "where do I start?" paralysis
- **Pressure Delegation**: Infrastructure specialists handle specific domains (DevOps, documentation, monitoring) with clear scope boundaries
- **Damage Prevention**: Critical user-facing issues addressed first (package.json) to prevent repository abandonment

**Project-Specific ED Considerations**:
Infrastructure work can feel "boring" after exciting development achievements, but user issues (GitHub Issue #1) provide concrete motivation and clear success criteria that prevent abandonment.

## Executive Summary

This meta-PRP transforms the Vespera Atelier repository from an internal development environment into a polished, publicly consumable monorepo. Real users are encountering critical onboarding failures (missing package.json preventing `pnpm install`) that must be addressed immediately. We have 3 pending Dependabot PRs for GitHub Actions updates and infrastructure gaps that prevent successful public consumption.

The systematic approach addresses user-facing issues first (Priority 1: Onboarding), then infrastructure stability (Priority 2: CI/CD), then polish (Priority 3: Documentation), and finally ongoing maintenance (Priority 4: Monitoring). Success means any developer can clone, install, and contribute successfully - transforming the repository into a professional open-source project ready for community engagement.

**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `{To be assigned}`  
**Issue**: No ongoing infrastructure monitoring or automated maintenance procedures  
**Deliverables**: Health monitoring, automated maintenance procedures, dependency management automation

### Priority 5: Codex Protocol & Unified View System (Week 2)
**Location**: [05-codex-protocol-unified-view-system/](../05-codex-protocol-unified-view-system/README.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `{To be assigned}`  
**Issue**: No shared virtual file organization system between Vespera Scriptorium and Obsidian plugin  
**Deliverables**: Codex Protocol implementation, virtual view system, vespera-utilities package with 5+ view types

## Multi-Agent Coordination Structure

**Orchestrator Role**: Primary coordination hub for all specialist agents

**Agent Hierarchy**:
1. **Main Coordinator** (This agent): Orchestrates entire meta-PRP
2. **Priority Specialists**: One per priority area with domain expertise
3. **Implementation Agents**: Task-specific execution agents spawned as needed

**Coordination Workflow**:
1. Initialize orchestrator session from this directory
2. Create parent task for meta-PRP coordination
3. Break down into priority-specific subtasks
4. Spawn specialist agents for each priority area
5. Monitor progress and synthesize results
6. Complete meta-PRP with comprehensive artifacts

**Git Worktree Strategy**: Yes, using isolation for parallel infrastructure work

## Success Metrics

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] All 5 priority areas completed successfully
- [ ] All orchestrator artifacts stored and synthesized
- [ ] All deliverables meet quality standards
- [ ] GitHub Issue #1 resolved - users can successfully run `pnpm install`
- [ ] All Dependabot PRs merged and CI/CD pipeline validated
- [ ] Repository ready for public consumption and community contributions

**Quality Targets**:
- Context Engineering Score: 9/10
- Security Integration Score: 8/10  
- Multi-Agent Coordination Score: 9/10
- Executive Dysfunction Support Score: 9/10

**Validation Requirements**:
- Fresh clone test - `git clone && pnpm install` must succeed
- CI/CD pipeline execution - all workflows must pass
- Documentation validation - setup instructions must be complete and accurate
- User experience testing - onboarding flow must be smooth for new contributors
