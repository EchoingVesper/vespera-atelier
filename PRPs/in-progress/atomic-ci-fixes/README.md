## 🤖 Orchestrator Integration

- **Session ID**: `session_6375af58_1755338579`
- **Parent Task**: `{To be filled during initialization}`
- **Working Directory**: `/home/aya/dev/monorepo/vespera-atelier/PRPs/in-progress/atomic-ci-fixes`
- **Coordination Method**: Sequential atomic task execution with orchestrator coordination

## 📚 Key Concepts

### What We're Building

**Atomic CI/CD Fixes**: Decomposes critical CI/CD issues into highly granular, context-contained atomic tasks specifically designed for execution by resource-constrained local LLMs

### Why This Structure

- **Systematic Approach**: Each task is self-contained with minimal context loading and clear input/output specifications
- **Agent Coordination**: Designed for multi-agent execution via orchestrator with specialist task assignment
- **Executive Dysfunction Support**: Pre-structured prompts eliminate decision paralysis for local LLM execution

### 🔄 PHASE 3 (ACTIVE): Strategic Research-First Analysis

**Current Status:**
- **✅ Success**: 9 tests now passing (up from ~4 previously)
- **❌ Failed**: 23 tests consistently failing - require systematic analysis
- **⏱️ Hanging**: 6 tests running indefinitely (months old, likely frozen)
- **🚫 Cancelled**: 4 tests cancelled due to configuration or dependency issues
- **⏭️ Skipped**: 4 tests skipped for various reasons

**Phase 3 Strategic Approach: Research → Analysis → Targeted Implementation**
After Phase 2's broad workflow fixes, remaining test failures require evidence-based analysis before implementation attempts.

**Data Source**: [GitHub PR #15 Checks](https://github.com/EchoingVesper/vespera-atelier/pull/15/checks) - Real test failure data

**Strategic Coordination Pattern:**

**Phase 3A: Individual Test Research** (37 research agents)
- Extract actual test details from GitHub Actions logs
- Analyze real error messages and failure patterns  
- Research root causes based on evidence, not assumptions
- Document solution approaches with actual context

**Phase 3B: Analysis & Categorization** (1 analysis agent)
- Consolidate 37 research findings into problem categories
- Identify patterns: environment, configuration, code, infrastructure issues
- Create targeted implementation strategy based on actual findings
- Reduce 37 individual fixes → estimated 10-15 consolidated fix tasks

**Phase 3C: Targeted Implementation** (10-15 implementation agents - TBD)
- Execute fixes based on evidence-gathered implementation plan
- Focus on root causes rather than individual symptoms
- Batch similar fixes for efficiency
- Validate systematically across consolidated categories

**Phase 3 Coordination Structure:**

1. **Priority 11: Research Coordination** - [11-phase3-research-coordination/](11-phase3-research-coordination/)
   - **Phase 3A**: 37 research agents analyzing individual tests with real GitHub data
   - **Phase 3B**: 1 analysis agent consolidating findings into implementation strategy
   - **Phase 3C**: 10-15 targeted implementation agents (based on Phase 3B findings)
   - Focus: Evidence-based approach with systematic consolidation

**Strategic Benefits:**
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions based on actual GitHub Actions error data
- **Consolidation**: Reduce 37 → ~10-15 implementation tasks through pattern recognition
- **Risk Mitigation**: Understand root causes before attempting fixes
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus implementation effort on actual problems
- **Phase Gates**: Clear gates between research, analysis, and implementation

**Improved Executive Dysfunction Design:**
- **Research First**: No premature implementation attempts
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions based on real data, not assumptions  
- **Clear Phase Gates**: Can't proceed to implementation without completed research
- **Consolidation Strategy**: Reduces complexity through pattern recognition
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear metrics for each phase completion

**Strategic Validation:**
After Phase 3A (Research):
1. Review all 37 research findings
2. Identify patterns and consolidation opportunities
3. Create evidence-based implementation strategy
4. Decide on actual number of implementation agents needed (likely 10-15)

After Phase 3C (Implementation):
1. Push consolidated fixes to GitHub
2. Monitor complete test run with systematic validation
3. Verify targeted fixes resolve multiple related test failures
4. Achieve 100% test success rate through strategic approach

### **Phase 3 Context/Inputs**

- **Individual Test Analysis**: Each test needs dedicated investigation
- **Historical Context**: Some hanging tests haven't worked since monorepo migration
- **Agent Coordination**: 74 agents working in parallel across 4 test categories
- **Orchestrator Management**: Full orchestrator coordination for agent spawning and tracking
- **Root Cause Focus**: Deep analysis rather than broad workflow changes
- **Final Validation**: All tests must pass before PR merge

## 🎨 Vision

All CI/CD workflows pass consistently with reliable branch protection, proper workspace configuration, and enhanced build processes that work on fresh repository checkouts.

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**Achievement Scores Target**:

- Context Engineering: 9/10
- Security Integration: 8/10
- Orchestrator Integration: 9/10
- Multi-Agent Coordination: 9/10
- Executive Dysfunction Design: 10/10
- Future Automation Readiness: 10/10

**Git Worktree Strategy**: Not applicable (sequential atomic tasks)

**Next Phase**: Obsidian Backend Integration Research & Planning (blocked until CI fixes complete)

---

**Remember**: Each atomic task must be executable by local LLM with minimal context. All changes must be easily reversible with automated validation.
