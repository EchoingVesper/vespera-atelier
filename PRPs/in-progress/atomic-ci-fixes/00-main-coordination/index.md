# Atomic CI/CD Fixes Meta-PRP - Main Coordination

**Meta-PRP ID**: `ATOMIC_CI_FIXES_META_PRP_2025`  
**Type**: Multi-Agent Coordination with Full Orchestrator Integration  
**Priority**: High - Critical CI/CD Issues  
**Estimated Total Effort**: 4-6 hours across multiple atomic tasks  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Session**: `session_6375af58_1755338579`  
**Parent Task ID**: `{task_id}`

## Foundational Philosophy: Executive Dysfunction as Design Principle

**Core ED Principles for This Meta-PRP**:

- **Momentum Preservation**: Atomic tasks with minimal context loading preserve progress across sessions
- **Lid Weight Reduction**: Pre-structured prompts eliminate decision paralysis for local LLM execution
- **Pressure Delegation**: Context-contained tasks (<2000 tokens) distributed to specialist agents
- **Damage Prevention**: Each change easily reversible with automated rollback capabilities

**Project-Specific ED Considerations**:
Designed specifically for local LLM execution (8GB VRAM constraint) with maximum context per task of 2000 tokens, precise diff format outputs, and automated validation methods.

## Executive Summary

This meta-PRP decomposes critical CI/CD issues from comprehensive code review into highly granular, context-contained atomic tasks specifically designed for execution by resource-constrained local LLMs. Each task is self-contained, requires minimal context loading, and has clear input/output specifications with structured prompts.

The systematic approach enables local LLM automation of CI/CD fixes while maintaining quality and integration coherence. Success means all CI workflows pass, branch protection is configured, and build processes work reliably across the monorepo structure.

## Priority Structure

### Priority 1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes (2-3 hours)

**Location**: [01-critical-infrastructure/](../01-critical-infrastructure/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `branch-protection-config`, `maintenance-debug-logging`, `maintenance-error-recovery`  
**Issue**: CI/CD infrastructure failures preventing reliable builds and deployments  
**Deliverables**: Working branch protection, enhanced maintenance workflow with debug logging and error recovery

### Priority 2: Configuration Fixes (1-2 hours)

**Location**: [02-configuration-fixes/](../02-configuration-fixes/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `fix-package-json-workspaces`, `verify-workspace-paths`, `fix-ci-working-directories`  
**Issue**: Monorepo workspace configuration and CI path mismatches causing build failures  
**Deliverables**: Corrected package.json workspaces, validated paths, fixed CI working directories

### Priority 3: Enhancement Tasks (1-2 hours)

**Location**: [03-enhancement-tasks/](../03-enhancement-tasks/index.md)  
**Status**: [DRAFT]  
**Orchestrator Tasks**: `add-venv-creation`  
**Issue**: Build scripts assume virtual environment exists, causing fresh checkout failures  
**Deliverables**: Enhanced build scripts with automatic virtual environment creation

## Multi-Agent Coordination Structure

**Orchestrator Role**: Primary coordination hub for all specialist agents

**Agent Hierarchy**:

1. **Main Coordinator** (This agent): Orchestrates entire meta-PRP
2. **Priority Specialists**: One per priority area with domain expertise
3. **Implementation Agents**: Task-specific execution agents spawned as needed

**Coordination Workflow**:

1. Initialize orchestrator session from this directory
2. Create parent task for meta-PRP coordination
3. Break down into priority-specific subtasks
4. Spawn specialist agents for each priority area
5. Monitor progress and synthesize results
6. Complete meta-PRP with comprehensive artifacts

**Git Worktree Strategy**: No, sequential approach (atomic tasks are independent and safe for linear execution)

## Success Metrics

**Completion Criteria**:

- [ ] All 3 priority areas completed successfully

## Orchestrator Integration Commands

**Initialize Session**:

```bash
# From this directory, initialize orchestrator session
orchestrator_initialize_session working_directory="$(pwd)"
```

**Create Parent Task**:

```bash
# Create the main coordination task
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Atomic CI/CD Fixes Meta-PRP Coordination" \
  description="Multi-agent coordination for atomic CI/CD fixes meta-PRP execution" \
  complexity="very_complex" \
  task_type="breakdown" \
  specialist_type="coordinator"
```

**Monitor Progress**:

```bash
# Check overall status
orchestrator_get_status

# Query specific tasks
orchestrator_query_tasks parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Ready to Execute

**Pre-flight Checklist**:
