# Priority 9: Phase 3 Hanging Tests Resolution

**Parent Task ID**: `{parent_task_id}`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: [TODO]  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Specialist Type**: devops + tester  
**Local LLM Ready**: ‚úÖ High (with research phase)
**Test Category**: Hanging Tests (6 tests)

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: 6 GitHub Actions tests have been "in progress" for months, never completing and likely hanging indefinitely.

**Impact**: These hanging tests consume resources and indicate serious underlying issues that may affect system stability.

**Historical Context**: User reports these 6 tests were created months ago and have never worked properly, likely since the vespera-scriptorium package was merged into the monorepo.

## Executive Dysfunction Design Focus

**Lid Weight Impact**: 6 hanging tests analyzed separately to identify root causes  
**Momentum Preservation**: Each test gets dedicated research + implementation agent pair  
**Pressure Delegation**: Distributed across 12 agents (6 research + 6 implementation)
**Damage Prevention**: Hanging test resolution prevents resource waste and system instability

## Problem Analysis

**Likely Root Causes:**
- **Infinite Loops**: Tests stuck in infinite execution loops
- **Resource Deadlocks**: Tests waiting for resources that never become available
- **Network Timeouts**: Tests hanging on network operations without proper timeouts
- **Process Blocking**: Tests blocked waiting for processes that never complete
- **Monorepo Integration Issues**: Tests incompatible with monorepo structure
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Tests hanging due to unresolved dependency issues

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Research Analysis (6 agents)
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Agents**: 6 research specialists
- **Deliverables**: Hanging cause analysis and timeout analysis for each test
- **Tools**: Process analysis, log investigation, timeout pattern analysis

### Phase 1: Implementation Fixes (6 agents)  
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Agents**: 6 implementation specialists
- **Dependencies**: Corresponding research phase completion
- **Deliverables**: Hanging fixes with proper timeouts and error handling

## Investigation Focus Areas

**For Each Hanging Test:**
1. **Hang Point Analysis**: Where exactly does the test hang?
2. **Process State**: What processes are running/blocked when test hangs?
3. **Resource Usage**: What resources is the hanging test consuming?
4. **Timeout Configuration**: Are there appropriate timeouts configured?
5. **Monorepo Impact**: How did monorepo integration affect this test?
6. **Dependencies**: What dependencies might be causing the hang?

## Research Methodology

**Each Research Agent Will:**
1. **Analyze Test Logs**: Find exact hanging point in execution
2. **Process Investigation**: Identify blocked processes or infinite loops
3. **Resource Analysis**: Check for resource contention or deadlocks
4. **Timeout Review**: Evaluate current timeout configurations
5. **Monorepo Impact**: Assess how monorepo structure affects test
6. **Best Practice Research**: Research proper test configuration for detected issues

## Implementation Strategy

**Each Implementation Agent Will:**
1. **Add Proper Timeouts**: Implement appropriate timeout mechanisms
2. **Fix Blocking Issues**: Resolve identified blocking conditions
3. **Resource Management**: Improve resource handling and cleanup
4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for edge cases
5. **Monorepo Compatibility**: Update test for monorepo structure
6. **Validation**: Test that hanging is resolved with timeout/completion

## Orchestrator Integration

**Create Priority Task**:
```bash
orchestrator_plan_task \
  title="Phase 3 Hanging Tests Resolution" \
  description="Analysis and resolution for 6 hanging GitHub Actions tests" \
  complexity="very_complex" \
  task_type="breakdown" \
  specialist_type="coordinator" \
  parent_task_id="{parent_task_id}"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern

**Workflow**: Research ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

1. **Research Agents (6)**:
   - Each analyzes one specific hanging test
   - Deep investigation into hanging cause and process state
   - Research proper timeout and error handling patterns
   - Document root cause and recommended approach

2. **Implementation Agents (6)**:
   - Receive detailed analysis from corresponding research agent
   - Implement timeout mechanisms and error handling
   - Fix identified blocking conditions
   - Test that hanging is resolved with proper completion/timeout

## Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] All 6 hanging tests analyzed for hang cause
- [ ] Root blocking issues identified and documented
- [ ] Proper timeouts and error handling implemented
- [ ] Tests either complete successfully or fail quickly with clear errors
- [ ] No tests remain in "hanging" state

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] All hanging tests complete within reasonable timeframes
- [ ] Proper error messages provided for legitimate failures
- [ ] Resource usage normalized (no resource leaks)
- [ ] System stability improved with hanging resolution

## Expected Outcomes

**Possible Resolutions per Test:**
- **Fix and Complete**: Hanging issue resolved, test now completes successfully
- **Fix and Fail Fast**: Hanging resolved with quick failure and clear error message
- **Timeout with Grace**: Proper timeout implemented with cleanup
- **Conditional Execution**: Test configured to only run when dependencies are met
- **Test Deprecation**: Obsolete hanging test properly removed from workflow

## Validation Protocol

**After Implementation:**
1. **Hang Test**: Verify test no longer hangs indefinitely
2. **Timeout Test**: Confirm timeouts work as expected
3. **Resource Test**: Check for proper resource cleanup
4. **Error Handling**: Validate clear error messages for failures
5. **Integration Test**: Ensure fixes don't break other tests
