# Implementation Phase: Failed Tests Resolution

This phase contains individual implementation tasks for each failed test.

## Subtasks (23 implementation agents)

Each implementation agent receives research from corresponding research agent and:
- Implements fix based on research findings
- Validates that failed issue is resolved
- Tests implementation for regressions
- Documents implementation results

## Execution Pattern

1. **Load Research**: Get findings from corresponding research agent
2. **Implement Fix**: Apply researched solution approach
3. **Validate Resolution**: Test that failed issue is resolved
4. **Document Results**: Store implementation details in orchestrator

## Expected Deliverables

- Working fixes for each failed test
- Validation that failed behavior is resolved
- Implementation documentation and results
- All fixes stored in orchestrator artifacts
